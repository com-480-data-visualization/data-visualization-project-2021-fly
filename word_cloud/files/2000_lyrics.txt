I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside
This is not how you want it to be

Baby, I will wait for you
Baby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do

Baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting
Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're —"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase"
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin'
"Fuck the other side! They're jealous!"
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels."
"Is that a May— what?!" "Baby, these wheels."
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel
Whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Yeah, yeah, whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
We gon' run this town tonight
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Ooh, whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
(Oh-oh)
Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? (Ooh, oh)

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (Mmm)
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation
But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
Now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding (Oohhh)
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding (I keep...)
Keep, keep bleeding love

Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love

I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory
'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd
And I still need you
I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh-oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you
Tonight
It's yo' birthday so I know you want to ri-i-ide out
Even if we only go to my-y-y house
Sip mo' easy as we sit up on my-y-y couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry-y-y out
You say you want passion, I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switchin' positions, you feel surrounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl

Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
I've been fiendin', wake up in the late night dreamin' about your lovin'
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
Don't need candles or cake, just need yo' body to make, ooh
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It's the best day of the year, girl)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It feels like, feels like, lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot)

See you sexy and them jeans got me on tent
1-2-3, think I got you pinned
Don't tap out; fight until the end
Ring that bell; we gon' start over again
We grindin' with passion 'cause it's yo' birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want your gift, girl
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
I've been fiendin', wake up in the late night dreamin' about your lovin'
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
Don't need candles or cake, just need yo' body to make, ooh
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It's the best day of the year, girl)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It feels like, feels like, lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot)

First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I pleased that body, body, ah-ooh
Or, girl, without a broom, I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed
You close your eyes as I improv between yo' legs
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl, you know I'm more than able to please, yeah
Say you wanted flowers on the bed
But you got me and hours on the bed

Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
I've been fiendin', wake up in the late night dreamin' 'bout your lovin'
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
Don't need candles or cake, just need yo' body to make, ooh
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It's the best day of the year, girl)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It feels like, feels like, lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot)

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Okay, let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, "Move," a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Looking back at me, I see that I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold

Cold to you, I'm sorry 'bout all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You can see me stand on my own again
'Cause now I can see
You are the antidote that got me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that got me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
I never meant to be so cold

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am (Is I'm sorry for the way I am)
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am (Is I'm sorry for the way I am)
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
Never believed in love at first sight
But I believe what i'm feeling tonight
Cause when I saw you across the room
I felt my heart going boom boom boom
I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked on you, oh girl
You know i'm falling for you because
I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked on you, oh girl
You know I'm falling for you because
One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize that I wanna be with you forever
So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you
I was waiting for a sign from you
Hoping you'd feel the same way too
When you looked at me and smiled
My heart was going a thousand miles
I stopped, turned around
I tried to keep my feet of the ground
As I stepped to you we touched
I knew you were feeling it too because
One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize that I wanna be with you forever
So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you
I know it's written all over my face
And girl you can believe it's true
That time could never erase these feelings I have for you
One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize that I wanna be with you forever
So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you
Yeah, oh, ah, ah, ah

What would I be without you?

What would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever

Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy

Security strapped, still stackin' a million
Stunt with a stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it, I'm willin' to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats (Look at me, man)
Hop up clean up outta the Phantom
The people go screamin' like an opera anthem (Let's go)
I did it before, do it again (Do it again)
I got it to blow, got it to spend (Got it to spend)
Fly as befo', cool as the wind
Got hits go back like Juice and Gin, yeah
Shine the best and diamond necklace (c'mon)

She be waitin' anticipatin' for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me comin' on like
(I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She diggin' my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall 'til my aura call her

I'm here, you're here, let's make it happen
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

Relax your mind, let your conscious be free
And I roll with the sounds of BBE
Do it, do it
You know what this is
It's Bad Boy bitch
Press Play!
Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart (heart!)
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart
(You are missing from my heart)
Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart
Baby it's no mystery
You're bringing out the best in me
And though I've been in love before
I've never had the kind of love that made me feel secure
I never thought that give and take
Mentality was right for me, mmm
You made me open up and see
That it's for real
And there's no other place I'd rather be
CHORUS:
Think about you all the time
24-7 babe
The love I have inside for you
Is more than any words can say
Pray to God on bended knee
We'll always be together babe
You and me
If there's a high or low
Anything can be babe
I'll be there for you
Pick you up off your feet, yeah
Pray to God on bended knee
We'll always be together babe
You and me
When I'm in my nine to five
I smile across my lips when I
Daydream about the night before
I count the minutes till I'm in your arms once more
My friends they don't understand, no
In me they see a brand new man
I give you props and tell them that
My shorty's bout it
She personifies the love she gives
CHORUS
Oh how I've waited for this moment in my life
It's you that I adore
Baby with you I am secure
My life is in your hands
And now I understand
What it means to be in love again, oh
Never gonna let u go, oh no
Chorus until end
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah

Broke up with my girl last night so I went to the club
So I went to the club
Put on a fresh white suit and the mini coupe sittin' on dubs
Sittin' on dubs
I'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love
Show me some love
If you know what I mean, uh-huh
E'rybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot
I stepped in the spot
Two hundred bitches in the building ain't none of them hot
Ain't none of them hot
Except for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top
On the way, at the top

Freeway burnt out
Got a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be yo spot
Be yo spot
Put you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top
And I end up on top
Don't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby
Just lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a God damn star baby
So my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car?
Those keys to the car
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorr'

Ooh, she made us drinks to drink; we drunk 'em, got drunk

Ba ba da da

Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Take a look at our world, friend
And see the news at 10 o'clock (ba ba da da)
When I'm watchin' the world's trends
I never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
There's been some guys with some lassos
Visiting a mountain who's back broke
But someone else found true love again:
Hugh Hefner says he has three new girlfriends
And the networks now are so bold
That Snoop will probably get his own show
And I'm afraid I might tune in
Find Donald Trump and Rosie fightin' Hulk Hogan
I'm used to Ludacris but land sakes
Man, now there's filthy Justin Timberlake
And that Akon rap guy don't know what love is
There's kids developing a fan base
Meetin' total strangers out on MySpace
I know that's fun but if I had a new daughter or son
I would still not let 'em play with a gun
Take a look at our world, friend
And see the news at 10 o'clock (ba ba da da)
When I'm watchin' the world's trends
I never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
Take a look at our world, friend
Even though you'll wanna gawk (ba ba da da)
Watch what's on your doorstep
You better go and get a lock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
There's been some wild scenes in Borat
And it's kinda hard to ignore that
But that Nativity movie they made it was well done
Though the girl that was playing the Virgin wasn't one
And I know you heard some bad talk
About those girls the Pussycat Dolls
But they're tryin' to fix the unemployment rate
By themselves, find some ladies they can train
I know DaVinci Code is jive, though
It seems as if America don't think so
If that you ain't up on that then go get plugged in
Ain't gonna read their family Bible
But I know they've seen the Family Guy though
And we've told 'em before
They oughta know there's a wolf pack at the door
They should be practicing the art of war, drawn swords, but
Nah, na, na, na, na, na
CHORUS
Girls gone-a wild and I think that most teens now
And dirty old men find it fun (I'm not one)
We've got guys who'll probably go to "Saw 5"
And say it wasn't even scary (Man, I'm serious)
We've got sources insistin' that sports is infested
With guys who cheat to try and grow strong (so prove 'em wrong)
We've got the crudest gags I've ever heard
I've seen comedians go a full hour (and not say a nice word)
And we could still perish any moment
And yet we joke about the future like it's Dave and Conan
Call me dumb, call me nuts, call me chump
So what, you'd better shout it
'Cause everyone is goin' to sleep and this is why I'm hot about it
2 Timothy 3:1-5
But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days
People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive
Disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love
Unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good
Treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
Having a form of godliness but denying it's power
Have nothing to do with them
J. Holiday
Oo-oh, oo-oh
(Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay)
Put you to bed, bed, bed
Put you to bed, bed, bed

Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed

I'm starin' at you while you sleep
Irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (Ooh, breathe)
Take you into my senses
Wake up it's time to finish
Round two, round two
Matter of fact, it's closer to three
She like, "How long I been sleep?"
Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me
"My angel, this is wonderful"
Thanks for letting me bless ya
Come down, fly right
Drift back into heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You love it (you love it)
Everytime (everytime)
We touchin' (we touchin')

Then I'mma rock ya body
Turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
The sun ain't the only thing that's shinin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Now I'mma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody, Ay
Everybody
Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Here at W-I-Z, we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfucking hits

One fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checking your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now were both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere

And then I'ma take you home with me

Nick Wiz ft. Native Assassins - “Hardcore”


Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?

Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?

Where is
The ones who bit my style to the final crumbs?!?  I’m burning brothers
By the bags and snatch the breath from your lungs!  Niggas be
Talking ‘bout their guns and whatnot, couldn’t starе in my
Bloodshot eyes and tell thosе lies, so just stop, kid!
I got ‘nough spots to blow up!  Emcees self-destruct
When they duplicate the product—what?!?  The madness
Is drastic, bastards!  Niggas are wishing
They stayed inside their father’s prophylactic!  My style
Unorthodox when I hold the reefer, and the litters couldn’t compete
With where my cold stone blacker than Jesus’ skin!  On the real
I dare you bring a mortal in!  I’ll rip him from the seams
And watch his dreams shatter like porcelain!  Word to the black
Heart beating in my chest, I’m kind of vexed at the
Pseudo-rebels going pop like blood vessels
I thought you knew!  You had to get burnt to learn the rule
Enter my zone, I’m fucking up your dome like Catholic schools
I don’t be bullshitting, I’m real like AIDS for always
So turn the page and watch the phrase jump through like gamma rays
Keeping out of TECs/text, verbally, we duel to death
Your soul is laid to rest like two lyrical shots up in your chest
Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?

Third Reich is steaming, my blood is reaching its boiling point
My eyes turn red as vessels steadily burst in my head
I despise hearing all of these lies.  You might as well be
A reporter for that Inquiring Mind.  This real
Shit sticks in your brain like Jesus’s thorns.  Your mother’s
Heart is torn from all the bullshit that you’ve sworn
Emcees fall off the shelf like Barbie dolls at Toy “R” Us, I pick them up
I lace the blunt, now I’m smoking ‘em like angel dust
Ain’t gotta trust the truth’ll set you free.  Emcees are shackled
Like slaves to their lies—don’t ever try to run from me
You’ve been caught out there like a fag in drag.  Now emcees
Skip, tag, play Hot Peas and Butter, and let their pants sag
Taking your own life on the microphone?  Please stay home
It’s not right to commit suicide in the public’s eye
Real emcees are rarely spotted like the Bigfoot
Tourist attraction like the Loch Ness Monster in my neighborhood

Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
I inject
Terror in bloodstreams like heroine, go the full nine
Keep peddling, severing any heads involved in meddling
Deep internal affairs, press guys I never cleared
Imitators false as breast implants: beware!
Chairs break fan, thoughts like atmosphere polluted
Where’s the gat?!?  Here’s the gat—now shoot it!
I dare you, punk!  I dare you front with a straight face
Bite the bullet, hide the taste of full clips, boots they lace
To step on bullshit

Looking in the toilet at another trash emcee
I’m vexed, living like 
Mass hysteria air-raids your area 
Bow down and praise the immortal warlord descended
From the Heavens, bringing Armageddon, nuclear war
Aftermath, wackness is burnt in the backdraft
So get your vaccination for the plague—I’m like the flu
(What you gonna do when we come for you?!?)

Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?  (Everybody’s) hardcore!  (Him and him is)
Hardcore!  (Are you) hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This "love sick" thing
I like serious relationships and, uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long

My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back!

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, God!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love!)

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now, baby!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now!)
She can't help it (And now you got me)
You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
So in love with you
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)

With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback

If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)

With the plush leather guts steady gripping the butt
Oh you for sure with it, then pull your pistol
Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it

Mean mugging like a motherfucker, my hand on my dick

We started off with Shake Em Off so look partner, oh guess who?
It's them boys from the bottom who took you down 85
And hit you with that U-Way so look here don't be surprised
We bucking, blowing, chilling and sipping on something good

But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say, hey

Nobody gonna love me better (Mmm)
I'ma stick wit' you forever (Mmm)

Ain't nothin' else I could need (Nothin' else I could need)
And now

I got you
We'll be makin' love endlessly
I'm with you (Baby, I'm wit' you)
Baby, you're with me (Baby, you're with me higher)

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me, yeah yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you (Ah ah, ah, ah)
Because of you, mmh, ooh...

Out there and sober as well from loneliness
Please do persist, girl it's time we met and made a mess

I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly

A cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress
Wish you were here I'm a wounded satellite
I need you now, put me back together, make me right

I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly
I'm calling your name up into the air
Not one of the others could ever compare!
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!

Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
Illuminated attic
Fate, or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while
Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
De-fragmenting the attic
Fate, or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while, oh
I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly

Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She turned away what was she looking at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl when she left me

What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?

Don't turn away, what are you looking at?
He was so happy on the day that he met her
Say, what are you looking at?
I was a superman, but looks are deceiving
The roller-coaster ride's a lonely one
I paid a ransom note to stop it from steaming
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a teenage girl when she met me

What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?
The girl got reasons
They all got reasons

What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do if I follow?

Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me
The day that she left me
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me
The day that she left me
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
The day that she met me
The day that she met me
Hey Deb
Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?
I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me

I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe

Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me



It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure
Find yourself a girl and settle down
Live a simple life in a quiet town

Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes

Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife

Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)

Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell

So steady as she goes
When you have completed what you thought you had to do
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue
Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)

Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell

So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes

Settle for a world, neither up or down
(Settle for a world, neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round
(Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round)
Settle for a girl, neither up or down
(Settle for a girl, neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round
(Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)

Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?

Her face is a map of the world
Is a map of the world
You can see she's a beautiful girl

And everything around her is a silver pool of light
The people who surround her feel the benefit of it
It makes you calm
She holds you, captivated in her palm

Cause we can't stop
Yeah, let me tell you something
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick, named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers to spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me, dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
And I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stop to this
I can't help it, I'm an optimist
And I'ma make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon' rock to this
Now say my name

Ay yo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never the ladiez hypnotize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bouswar
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D

(La, la, la)
C'mon, work it out, girl
I wanna see you work it out, girl
I'm tired of working every day for a dollar
About to choke on my own blue collar
This ain't gonna last
Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion
I can't make a move too fast
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run
My baby's been working as a cashier
She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song
There're some places that we ain't been
Some things we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run
Awww Yah!
Billys at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!
She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!
Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Cause life looks good, good, good
So good, good, good
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles ... on
I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart

You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight...

Life is just a moment, we're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us if we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When there's darkness all around me, you're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind

You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Oh, tonight
Oh, you're my angel, aha
All I need tonight
You're my angel (my angel)

You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, my miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight (tonight)
You're all I need tonight
All I need tonight
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
You're all I need to know
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
Oh, you're my angel
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
My angel, my, my, my, my, my angel
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
My angel, my angel

Weebie! Holla at me (c'mon), I'm at the ball
I got like twelve bottles of bubbly (oh)

I like the way she shake it in the thong - OOOHHHWEE!
The way she make it twurk and grab the wall - OOOHHHWEE!
Oh, baby you know whatchu doin - OOOHHHWEE!
No Limit got the steps bouncin and movin - OOOHHHWEE!

I know a big girl, with a ironed skirt
Give her couple dollars, she'll make it work
I mean holla at me whoadie, you know our crew large
My fantasy's to have sex wit two broads
On a boat or a plane, some exotic cars
From a Bentley to a Lex, girl, bring the toys
On the dance floor, shawty started takin it off
Took her to the V.I.P., started breakin me off
Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists
I told her "Wait, it don't stop, keep drinkin the Cris'"
I'm a country boy just like the Dukes of Hazzard
See a fine chick, you know I'm gon' grab her
Annie May girl where you at?
This No Limit boy tryin to do that thang
I said "Rock the boat, don't let it sank"
It's time to go to war, I got the tank

 Say that then

I could work, put ya body, c'mon back it up, back it up
You know Weebie and Master P, we gon' tank it up, tank it up
Turn around to the ground, you know how it goes
Catch the flow, tippie-toe, come and wobble some mo'
Like you know how I do it so don't act surprised
For a fact gotchu dancin 'til you hurtin your thighs
Now won'tcha tune it up and wobble wit it
Act a fool and wobble wit it
Won'tcha make it hustle, ooh baby don't pull a muscle
Gotcha workin on the wall 'til you run outta breath
No Limit like I told ya so y'all give us respect
Now you could shake it like a dog, break my fuckin balls
Do it how ya do it, lemme see ya take it off


Now won'tcha rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on
Rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock
Now won'tcha turn around and hustle wit it
Back it up and hustle wit it, test around and hustle wit it
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Mary had a big ol' butt, in them tight ass jeans it'd show
And every club that Mary was at them thugs were sure to go
I mean she had bow-legs wit the curves just like a bottle
Project chick but pretty just like a model
When I'm rollin through the hood she on dubs
Don't mind gettin in and shakin her thang in the club
I mean, beat bopper she loved the tote shoppers
Call her head nurse then I'mma be the doctor
A real country mamma cook grits and eggs
And she won't leave the farm except to get paid
Candies on twat cause she love to ball
Find her at the mizzle on the dresser or the mall
Buyin, high heels on some leather boots
Or lookin for them ballers wit the crazy loot, WHAT?!



Where them No Limit boys at? Throw them 'bows

The party's not over, OOOHHH-WEE-WEE!
(Ooh-ooh) Wassup, boo? (Yeah)
Hahahaha, yeah, that's right

Another shady mission (Ooh)
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothin' but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

I wanna be the one who (Hahaha)
Who you can depend on who (Playa cards right)
Who'll be the one who'll be there (Take your time)
(Who'll be the one) Through the thick and thin (Be patient)
Oh, go by the water, we will (Don't rush)
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night (It's goin' down)
And we will be forever more
No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside (I feel inside)
And it's gonna be alright and it'll be ok
If we try and take our time
Please, baby, take your time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one who

I wanna be the one who (Hey)
Who you can depend on who (Depend on)
Who'll be the one who'll be there (Who'll be the one?)
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will (Yeah, yeah)
Be there 'til the morning (We'll be there)
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more (Come on, yeah, over)

You gotta playa cards right on one (Ooh, yeah)
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? (No, no, no)
If you be patient, and you take your time (Be patient, baby)
And you finesse it, nine times out of ten times (Ten)
Homeboy, you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush, and you just be manhandlin'
(It takes a real man) Yeah, go home tonight, haha
Playa cards right, nigga (Yeah)
Take your time (Yeah, be the one)
Be patient, go slow, it's better that way (Oh, yeah)
Haha, playa your cards right (Yeah, be the one)

Who you can depend on who (Depend on)
Who'll be the one who'll be there (Who'll be the one?)
Through the thick and thin (Oh, hey)

Be there 'til the morning (We'll be there)
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more (Yeah, yeah, forever)

Take your time, nigga (Take your time)
Don't be in such a rush (In a rush)
Haha
You got to be patient, man, be patient, haha (Ooh, be so)
It ain't going nowhere one, haha (Nowhere)
Get some champagne (Haha, be forever)
Bring some roses or somethin', you know
Play some soft shit, light a fire (Luther Vandross)
You got to be cool with it (Teddy, Teddy)
You got to be slow with it (Ooh, be so)
You got to be patient, haha
You got to playa your cards right on one
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? (Nowhere)
If you be patient, and you take you time, and you finesse it
(Be forever)
Yeah, I'll tell him to take it slow
Everybody's movin' so fast these days
Shoulda listened to every word you said
They gon' you love you 'cause you beautiful
But it's another reason why they wanna hurt you
But you know, rest in peace, bruh
She started her new life ten dollars in debt
That's all it took to get started back then
A trip to the courthouse across the state line
No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind
He was eighteen, she wasn't
But she said she was and never thought twice
Came back home as my daddy's wife
She just shook her head when her momma said
"Are you sure he's the one?" She was
He took a job and farmed on the side
He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied
Changes were coming to their little world
She said "What would you like, a boy or a girl?"
He said "Are you?"
She said she was and never thought twice
'Bout takin the next step in building their lives
Soon there were three and she tried to be
Everything to us And she was
Those precious moments turned into years
In what seemed like the blink of an eye
I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her
"Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?"
She said she was but she thought twice
Holdin' my hand as she let go of life
Daddy always said a woman like her
Would be hard to give up
And she was
She was
If there ever was a picture of love
She was

Yea, yea, yea

T.U.G. {*hums*}
Mmmmmm bada-boom
Sometimes in the morning
My coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes
Before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work
Every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been
And in a crowded elevator
I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting
Looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies
And I can't help but laugh
That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me
That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
An sometimes in the evening
I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the sent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again
That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And thos "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me
That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
In a white cotton dress
That's just a wildfire that I ain't put out yet
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me
That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, Ill be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is
Oh fuck
You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
And all of them coming anonymously, so they leave no trail
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
Starsky and Hutch chimps
A chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
If I had to guess, I'd say the monkey-sender thinks its great
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight
Some chimps in hard-hats
Chimps a-working on a chain gang
Some chimps who love cats
Burning rubber in a Mustang
A birthday wishing chimp
A chimp in black, like a goth
A going fishing chimp
A British chimp in the bath
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps in hard-hats
Some chimps who love cats
I got some shaved chimps
Thats chimps devoid of any hair
I got depraved chimps
Dressed up in a-womens underwear
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me

Dance and make all the niggas look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin hell

Before the police went on all them weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose with it

I bet she can't wiggle like with a dick in her
Have a motor booty contest and pick a winner
When she runnin', you never see a ho come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more

My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news
About how they're losing billions
And it's up to me and you to come running to the rescue
Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear
Cause they're selling make-believe
And we don't buy that here
Cause in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down

Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cause he ain't the one to blame
When I look down to see his calloused hands
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad
Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
In the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
They're shuttin' Detroit down
Yeah (come on)

It's the - MH and Pied Pied Pied Piper
MH and Pied Pied Pied Piper
We get the girls so-so hyper
We make 'em say da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Pulled up to the party, in a black Lexus jeep (yeah)
Hop up out the whip I'm feelin' freaky (ohh)
All the ladies comes surround me
Cause I'm so important, like the H in Hi-C
This one girl, she making my body fien
I'm {fucked} up on hypnotic and ice cream
So I stepped to her, like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob the Jewler
Mami won't you come take a ride with me (ohh)
Be the girl of my fantasies
But first won't you do one thing for me
Baby won't you come pop ya booty for me (0hh)
Love the way you move so sexy (oohh oh)
I love it when you are all up on me
But one thing I have to see
Is the way you pop that booty (pop it for me)
I love the way you move so sexy
I love it when you all up on me (ohh oh)
Girl take the floor and you'll see

Making me wanna say
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Girl you shaped like a Coke bottle
So let me see you pop your thing full throttle


I don't do too many skinny or the runway frail
Thick with it is how we like it in the ATL
Sick with it, pants low with a real wide load
As soon as you hit the door everybody was like (OOOOH!)
And it's hard for you to go to the mall and buy clothes
Cause your waist is so little and your ass is like (WHOA!)
You poppin' that thing like a Luke video
Mesmerized by the sound and the way the flutes blow
Drink in my right hand, another in my left
Crew right behind me screamin So So Def
Now forgive me if I'm staring, but I gotta no one thing
How in the hell did you get all that in those jeans
I'm behind you +Grindin+, molding the +Clipse+
Cause I ain't never seen nobody pop they booty like dis
What I'm saying is, what you doing is major
The way you keep, shaking, shaking, shaking what cha momma gave ya

Mami dancing all on me
She not wearing any panties (ok)
I love it when she call me dada
The way she pops it like she from Jamaica


Yeah MH, JD, Piper, TUG
T. Scott you a fool fo dis one (oh yeah)
Holla! Chris Stokes
Holla at cha boy man
Bring that ish back or something
Whoa, it's morning
And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back the hands of time, no, no
Yes we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away
It's morning
Sunlight shines across your sleeping face, oh
A new day
Brings reality and we must go our separate ways
What a lovely night we had yeah, yeah
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about all the pain we caused
As we slept the night away
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Ooh hey, hey
As we lay
Didn't think about
The price we'd have to pay
No, no, no
It's morning
And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye baby
You're leaving me
I know you've got to hurry home to face your wife, wife
I would never want to hurt her, no, no, no
She would never understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
Ooh oh, whoa
I would never, never want to hurt her, no, no, no
She would never understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Ooh no, no hey, hey
As we lay
Didn't think about
The price we'd have to pay
No, no, no
We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second, in the minute
In the hour, hey, hey, hey
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Oh no, oh no, no
My love why can't you see
How loving you is killing me baby, baby
I can't think of no one else
Baby, baby I can't take it no more
You see I can't be in your life
You gotta go home to you wife
Oh it's morning
Passenger side, I slide on in
Vinyl seats soft from the heat of the sun
Chewin' on a Slim Jim, can't stop thinkin' 'bout him
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one
Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet in the passenger seat, yeah
I daydream of me an' a cold cotton pillow
And the feel of his skin
The window sill smiles and before I know it
I'm miles away a-sittin' next to him
Miles away a-sittin' next to him
Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet, yeah
Shiftin' those gears, baby, 1, 2, 3
Then he shifts those ocean eyes back to me
Can't imagine a moment any better than this
Then we kiss
Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, life's so sweet, it's...
Life's so sweet, it's...
Life's so sweet, it's...
So sweet in the passenger seat
Life's so, life's so, life's so sweet

Bo habibi, Nishtage'a, Bo habibi, Nishtage'a
It's official raise your glasses

And if he ever found out, he'd have me swimmin with the fishes in the water
Now I'mma say something crazy girl, I love you
I know we meeting for the first time in the club, but this feels like a deja vu
 - w/ ad libs

How many times Missy crushed the very best?

I got the guitar sounding like a sitar
Holy, holy, Jerry Wonder I need some security
Call police (*fades out*)
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Marion Barry calls for crack or like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' Cuban coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra
Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow


When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom
Uh huh yea, yeah
Duro!
You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in

I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I know Momma, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red
If you're wrong, my nigga
You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
Do you ever question your life?
Do you ever wonder why?
Do you ever see in your dreams...
All the castles in the sky?

Oh tell me why...
Do we build castles in the sky?
Oh tell me why...
Are the castles way up high
Please tell me why...
Do we build castles in the sky?
Oh tell me why...
Are the castles way up high

Do you ever question your life?
Do you ever wonder why?
Do you ever see in your dreams...
All the castles in the sky?

Oh tell me why...
Do we build castles in the sky?
Oh tell me why...
Are the castles way up high
Please tell me why...
Do we build castles in the sky?
Oh tell me why...
Are the castles way up high
Take the light
And darken everything around me
Call the clouds
And listen closely, I'm lost without you

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know
This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right
But I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

I'll mend myself before it gets me
I'll mend myself before it gets me
I'll mend myself before it gets me
I'll mend myself before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
And I'll rise above this, rise above this
Forty eight ways to say
That I'm feeling helpless
I've fallen down, fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Rise above this, rise above this doubt
I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
‘Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier
The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, is there healing?
In your name I find meaning
So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be okay

The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover
No one knows what it's like to be mistreated
To be defeated behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes

Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this
Nigga , I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this
Ma, you rolling? I'm as real as it gets
Big chips! (Woo!)
We off in Vegas drinking and partying

And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any D.A. why try to stop him
So any gunplay, that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was wopping
Rockin Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em

We in the islands chillin in the shade and shit you know
Blue waters, yellow sand, uh
Either I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin
Realized I can never win
Sometimes feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin?
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we supposed to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Sometimes I can never tell
If I've got something after me
That's why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we suppose to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me
I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Betrayed, I feel so enslaved
I really tried, I did my time
I did my time
I did my time!
I did my time!
I did my time!

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Oh God, the anger's changing me!
Oh God, the anger's changing me!
 (T3)
Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love

Think of her think of me
Think about us, it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you stay, where you subject to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you be
Say he the type of nigga that's hella cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me
 (T3)
Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love
How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day
People'll smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free
Love is always free

Real love, true love, tainted love, real love
True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real

You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience what some women won't in they lifespan
I'm sayin
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh then you'll, be, alright
(T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time, y'all, come on)
Then you'll, be, alright

8. The Day I meet Deanna. Rich Homie Quan : Can’t judge Her
He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I've known it from the start, all
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me, I'm
Too weird to live but much too rare to die
I brought you something close to me
Left for something you see though you're here
You haunt my dreams
There's nothing to do but believe
Just Believe
Just Breathe

Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe
Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe

I'm used to it by now
Another day, just believe
Just breathe, just believe
Just breathe
Lying in my bed
Another day, staring at the ceiling
Just breathe, another day
Another day, just believe
Another day
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now
Just breathe, just believe
Just breathe, just believe
Just believe, just breathe
Just believe

Another day, just believe
Another day
Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe
Another day (I do believe)
Another day (so hard to breathe)
Another day (not so hard to believe)
Another day, another day
Here's a little bit of old school for ya
That goes a little something like this...

I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(Throw the party of the month)
No, the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
(No, send them to a show)
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though
I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin' home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...
The doorbell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Ain't nobody do it like Aaron can)
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said
People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around, come on
(Come get it)
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)
People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh what what
(Come get it)
(Come get it)

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Things are goin' great then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellas, yo, ya gotta get out
(Hey man I heard this was an open house)
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
Well I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)
Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and
Another kid broke the lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh what what
(Come get it)
(Come get it)
People all around you gotta
(come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(come get it)
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Aaron C's in the house, here we go
Come with it

Break it down
(go go go go go...)

Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double
I'm dead (you're done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test
The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left
(AARON!!!???!!!)
Grounded

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around, come on
(Come get it)
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)
People all around you gotta

Na na na na
C'mon, yeah, come get it
Na na na na
Uh, uh, haha
Na na na na
Come get it
Na na na na
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I got a lot to say to you
Yeah, I got a lot to say
I noticed your eyes are always glued to me
Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush (2, 3, 4)

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two of us who's counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this

If you wanna play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending
Than have to forget you for one whole minute
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush (2, 3, 4)

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two of us who's counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this now

Rock and roll, baby
Don't you know that we're all alone now?
I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, honey (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby, we're all alone now?
I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, honey (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby, we're all alone now?
Give me something to sing about
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two of us who's counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than oh
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two of us who's counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, more than this, oh
He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashin' 5 below
It was freezing rain and spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans

I was afraid that he was dead, I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes, I said, "Old man are you OK?"

He said, "I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home"

Then he said, "I's just comin' 'round the barn
'Bout the time you grabbed my arm
When I heard mama holler, "Son, hurry up"
I was close enough for my old nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate, bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55, that's as close as I've been"

"Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home"

I said ,"Old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission"
He said, "Boy, if you'd've left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'"

"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home" (Almost home)
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home
When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were driving' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were looking at me
I held open the car door for you then you climbed
Inside and slid on over
To the other side.. I thought my, oh my

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's mustang, its his favorite car
And so I can't stay long..
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?
Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Sweet thing, sweet thing

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing
Oh come-on sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing

Yeah, come-on now a little now..
Do do do do do do do do do do do
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are
Do do do do do do do do do do do
I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how could you collect them all and throw them in my face?

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending 'til I break

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
If you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting
I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away
Would you be right here waiting?
Searching for the things to say
To keep me right here waiting
Ahh, dirty, dirty, filthy, filthy, nasty
Christina, you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up (Haha)
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party (Woo)

Another Rockwilder production
"Psycho"

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (yeah)

She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time
And it makes me wanna rewind
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again (yeah) 

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (yeah)
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the paranoid Flake-oh

She lays down on the sidewalk
Never very analytical
She is something simply beautiful
Re-appear when you feel magical
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
Yeah you know we're gonna win again

You're the one, you're the one who is the schizophrenic psycho 
Back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again

You're the one, you're the one who is the schizophrenic psycho!
If you're listening, whoa
Sing it back, whoa
String from your tether unwinds, whoa, whoa oh
Up and outward to bind, whoa, whoa

I was spinning free, whoa
With a little sweet and simple numbing me

Are you listening? Whoa
Sing it back, whoa
So, tell me what do I need, whoa, whoa
When words lose their meaning, whoa, whoa

I was spinning free, whoa
With a little sweet and simple numbing me, yeah
Stumble 'til you crawl, whoa
Sinking into sweet uncertainty

Are you listening? Are you listening?

If you're listening, whoa (If you're listening, are you listening?)
Sing it back, whoa (If you're listening, are you listening?)
And I'm still running away, whoa, whoa oh
Won't play your hide and seek game, whoa, whoa
I was spinning free, whoa
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
What a dizzy dance, whoa
And the sweetness will not be concerned with me

No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
Now, I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin paid over here

See my money maker, do my money maker (Crazy baby!)

M-I-S-sy, Missy be a freak
Sex so good, I can freak you in my sleep
Ice on my sleeve, I can make a room freeze
Pockets mo' bigger than a stripper booty cheeks
Dudes weak when they look at my physique
French on my feet cost a buck fifty
I don't swing from a pole, Missy swing from a tree
I'm Muhammad Ali cause I sting like a bee
Whatchu know about that? So cute and fat
I let him hit it once, I watch the dude come back
Cause the back so stacked like it's sittin on a jack
Missy be the mack, that's a true fact
Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
(This is...)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
See my money maker, do my money maker (Crazy baby!)
See my money maker, do my money maker (Serious maaaan!)
(ereh revo ti gnirb ybab, ytsrihT)
(ereh revo ti gnirb ybab, ytsrihT)

(I like this!)
Big things pop, little things stop
If you talk a lot, in your mouth you get socked
Miss don't flop cause I only get props
House on the water, Aston Martin in the lot
Look at my watch, cost a whole lot
So iced out you cain't see it tick-tock
Yeah, I'm so hot and I can't be topped
Artists drop down like Michael Jackson socks
Got the game lock, make ya body rock
If Missy ain't on it, then ya song don't knock
You might get mopped like a floor so don't walk
You don't need to spit unless you live what you talk
(Let's go!)
Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
(This is...)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
See my money maker, do my money maker (Crazy baby!)
See my money maker, do my money maker (Serious maaaan!)
(ereh revo ti gnirb ybab, ytsrihT)
(ereh revo ti gnirb ybab, ytsrihT)

Missy switch it up, do ya damn thang
Just like a chain, groupies wanna hang
Talk that slang, gon' head and let it bang
Make the hair stand like the hair on Don King
Boom, boom, shing, I shine like bling bling
Call me a queen, mean chicks stay in ya lane
My flow so mean, if you know what I mean
So fresh and clean, you can call me Irish Spring
Whatchu know about that? Talk like ex-lax
If ya game wack, then you ain't sayin jack
Just like that, yea yea, to get axed
Cause I got more hits than you can get out of a bat

Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin paid over here
(This is...)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
See my money maker, do my money maker (Crazy baby!)
See my money maker, do my money maker (Serious maaaan!)

When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that
She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over
I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk

Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fighting all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad
On the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
Tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout
I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
Life's not fair
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair

She loves me not
Loves me not
