							<div id="intro">
								<p>Music is an integral part of our lives. On average, people around the world listen to more than an hour of music a day.
									Alongside the art of music, there have been several eras of musical genres and artists. Since the 1950s, we have seen genres
									appear and disappear, but also mark generations. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, the Bee Gees, Michael Jackson,
									or more recently Beyonc√© or Drake have been listened to by millions of people from different continents and cultures.
									But are all these hits, all these artists really different or do we like a particular music?</p>

								<p>Our datastory will take you on a journey through the music world, looking at the music that has marked the last decades by
									 listening to the greatest hits, seeing the evolution of pop and rock music through the ages and the evolution of music in
									 terms of its characteristics.</p>

								<p>To see the evolution of music, what better way than to listen to it first, before diving into the analysis,
									here is the playlist gathering the biggest musical success of each year.</p>

									<h2>Evolution of pop and rock through decades</h2>
									<hr>
									<p>Pop, rock, Hip Hop, R&B, Rap, Jazz are all musical genres that we listen to regularly. When we look at these
										musical genres, only 2 occupy the top charts from the 50's until today, it' s pop and rock. These two musical
										genres have been among the most listened to for more than 70 years now, but does the pop of the 60's resemble
										the pop of today. Does the rock of the 60s with artists like the rolling stones sound like the rock of the 2000s
										with artists like Radiohead? That's the kind of thing we're going to try to find out in this section.</p>

									<p>To identify and compare the audio signature of pop and rock music trough years, we propose to use the following
										features provided by <a class="link" href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/">Spotify</a>
										that were then normalized: Tempo, Valence, Acousticness, Loudness, Energy and Danceability. Play with the buttons
										at the top and the bottom of the plot to compare two decade, you can switch between genre with pop and rock buttons.</p>

									<p>
										If we look at the values of the different features, some evolve in a rather small way while others go from one extreme to the other. For example, the <b> tempo of music increases significantly </b> with the appearance of genres such as electro and rap music, whose BPM is very high, even the other genres like pop and rock were influenced by this new kind of music. It's the opposite of what is happening with Acousticness, where today's <b>music relies mainly on electronic instruments such as samplers and synthesizers </b>reducing the acousticity of today's hits.
									</p>

									<p>
										Another point that may be interesting to look at is the <b>decrease of valence</b>. Valence represents the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed, angry). We can also link this to the evolution of music which has started to deal with sadder topics, we have seen the appearance of hits which talk about violence or depression.<b> Nowadays, music doesn't need to be about positive emotions to become popular.</b>

									<h2>Audio features, and what their history tells us about music</h2>
									<hr>
									<p>
										Let's take a step back and have a more general look at two specific features: <b>Danceability</b> and <b>Speechiness</b>.<br>
										How danceable were the Billboard Hot 100 hits in the last few decades, and how did that evolve through time ?<br>
										Does does today's music 'wordiness' compare to the 60's, the 70's, or the 80's ?</p>

									<div class="comment-title">More danceable hits...</div>
									<div class="comment-content">
										Throughout the 50's and 60's, genres present on the Billboard were a mishmash of <b>mood music</b>, <b>blues</b>, and <b>adult standards</b>. Come the 70's, a.k.a. <b>The Age of Disco</b>, the average danceability of successful hits went up with the rise of <b>funk music</b> and <b>Bubblegum pop</b>: catchy, upbeat songs that create a hypnotic, danceable feel. Between <b>classic rock</b>  and <b>hip hop</b>, the most successful hits of the 80's had variable danceability levels, but the nightclubs started to get more heated in the 90's with the arrival of <b>Electro</b> music, and hip hop becoming more and more geared towards dancing. <br>  

										The most appreciated tubes of the first decade of the 21st had a lot to do with emo music and indie pop, but <b>Reggaeton</b>  and <b>Latin</b>  pop hits were among the most danceable ones at the time. 
										In the last 10 years, most of the danceable Billboard 100 hits came out of an association of <b>pop</b>, <b>rap</b>  and <b>hip hop</b> . It seems like <b>genres are becoming a thing of the past</b> : for instance, the song 'Old Town Road', from Lil Nas X ft. Billy Ray Cyrus, was one of the most successful hits in the history of the Billboard. Who would've thought that such a risky crossover between country and hip-hop music would break so many records ?
									</div>
								</div>

								<div class="comment">
									<div class="comment-title">... and more talkative artists</div>
									<div class="comment-content">
										Speechy music often rhymes with <b>rap</b> music. By looking at the evolution of the speechiness feature, we can guess when the public started appreciating 'wordy' music. Between 2000 and 2005, Eminem and Lil' Wayne were often present in the top position, and were joined by Kanye West, Drake and Kendrick Lamar in the following years. 
										Those artists walked in the steps of icons like 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube, who revolutionized rap and hip hop music during the 90's. <br>
										Starting from the mid-2000's, average danceability and speechiness values more or less follow each other: when observed as a whole, music speechiness throughout the last decades shows how rap music, as a genre that started at block parties in New York City, evolved into mainstream hip hop, and is still rising in popularity nowadays.

									<h2>Key achievements and milestones in the Billboard Hot 100 chart</h2>
									<hr>
									<p> What makes a hit... a hit ? <br>
										We don't have access to the secret recipe to fame and glory yet, but one thing is undeniable: <b>songs that last in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for several weeks</b> definitely figured it out.<br>
										The following visualization is a <b>radial line chart</b> that displays the top artists, albums and songs which lasted the most number of weeks on the Billboard 100. Since a 100 positions might be considered as a big difference, the visualization offers the possibility of looking at the top hits and artists which <b>lasted the longest at position number 1</b> versus the ones that <b>lasted the longest at all rankings combined</b>.  <br></p>

									<div class="comment-content">
										The <b>top songs</b> that lasted the longest at position number 1 all feature <b>two or more artists</b>: it seems like the more artists collaborate on a song, the more fame it gains. 
										<br>
										Another striking fact: the data spans all hot 100 charts from 1958 to 2019. In the age of social media and hyper-connectivity, one would expect trends to change faster than the olden days. However, most top albums and songs in this chart (75% precisely) occur in the last 10 years of the data, which would indicate that <b>hits actually last longer on the charts nowadays</b>.
