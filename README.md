## Abstract
Did you listen to music today? The answer is probably yes. On average we listen to 2h30 of music a day, there are few things you spend more time on in your day. We suggest you dive into music and see its history and evolution. Our site offers you to look at the evolution of music from several angles. You can first look at the evolution of two genres that you listen to and that were already popular a few decades ago: rock and pop. Secondly, we will let you look at the evolution of the danceability and speechiness of music. Was past music more danceable or not, that's what we'll see? And finally we will be interested in the lyrics of the music, the lyrics of the music are a reflection of the state of society, you also have the opportunity to see how this has evolved.  

Don't hesitate to listen to the evolution of the music, we have put a playlist for that.
