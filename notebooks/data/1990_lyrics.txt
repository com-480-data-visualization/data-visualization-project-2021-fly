This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight
Why can't we just let love decide (let love decide)
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan (love is the master plan)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M (to the M)
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time (there'll come a time)
When love will blow your mind (blow your mind)
And everything you'll look for you'll find (take a look inside yeah)
That will be the time (that will be the time)
That everything will shine (forever)
So bright it makes you colorblind (you will be color blind)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (pearls, yeah yeah)
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world (give you the world)
All I can do is just offer you my love (all I can do)
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (diamonds)
Would you be, would you, would you, a happy boy or a girl
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy little baby)
If I could I would give you the worldDrums Please!

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwindIt's been a long time since you left me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to disappiont you
I didn't mean to tell you lies
And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why
One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try
It's been a long time since I've kissed you
It always used to feel so good
And if you knew how much I missed you
You'd forgive me if you could
And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try
One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try
And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why
And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try
One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try
Oh girl, you know I love you
I just want you to know
Our love, I'll always treasure
So please, just don't let me goNow you want my love, well that's alright
Well it will be there for you, morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good, and do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved, huh, hey that's okay
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down, a nigga gotta be true
Cause otherwise this beat ain't got no time for you

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Long as you know, that I can have any man I want to baby
That's actual and factual, but still I choose you
To be with me, and work on it, so you better not flake it up (Ohhh)

Of the track 'bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in
Booties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin'

W-N-E is in effect
PeaceShe leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
"Oh, what a morning"
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby, yeah)
Ahhh, ahh

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby)
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby, yeah)

All that she wants
All that she wantsSometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing
You're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
You went and saved the best for lastMine, immaculate dream
Made breath and skin, I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, (Who do you love) who do you love?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
(Who do you love) Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died


Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of rosesThis is Radio Freedom

Got to see that everywhere I turn

Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go

Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
How I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me

Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back

Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are
I love you

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go
Not able to let go
No, I won't let you go, no

I don't know what else to say
No, no, no, noIf you've ever been on television more than 5 times
Describing what the tornadoes sounded like...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever cut your grass and found a car...
You might be a redneck
If your dad walks you to school because your in the same grade...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever been too drunk to fish...
If somebody asks to see your ID and you show them your belt buckle..
If every day somebody comes to your house mistakenly thinking your having a
Yard sale
If you've ever had to haul a can of paint to the top of a water tower to defend
Your sister's honor..
You might be a redneck
If your dog and your wallet are both on a chain...
You might be a redneck
They always make fun of the way I talk, I keep telling them I said your gonna be
Real surprised when you get into the habit in St. Petersburg and say
"Y'all get into the truck, we goin up to the big house."
If you've ever financed a tattoo....
If you've ever made change in the offering plate...
You might be a redneck
We have words in the south they don't have in other parts of the country..
Now, you come to the south, we have words like...yu'nt to
We goin to the mall, yu'nt to?
What letter does that start with, does anybody know?
I like this word alot...aight
That's a word in Texas...aight
Round lunch time every day, you'll hear somebody say
"hey jeet yet, naw, dju? Yu'nt to? Aight."
If you go to the family reunion to meet women....
If you smoked during your wedding....
You might be a redneck
And last but not least
If you see a sign that says say no to crack
And it reminds you to pull your jeans up...
You might be a redneckMy old boy from the point
But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't got no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
I'm ready to begin
Another chance to get further away from where I've been
But I'll never forget
Everythang I went through I appreciate the shit
Because If I hada went and took the easy way
Wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food

Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with "red dye" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetti plus her monthly flow

They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had a lot, but thankful for
The little that I got
Why not be?
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at Tha Beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul foodIt's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin'
Flexin no half steppin
When I release the funky weapon
Like Ricochet ping ping ping
I make fans fell it even when I sing
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berenger in Platoon
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
Whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
Who ain't down with the format
When you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
That's wack
You trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee
And then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
And then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
You lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in
From the Smith and Wessons
Change the out look
Change the cover of the book
You hip hop crook and give back what you took
It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya
Boy stay real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

It's on again, yeah, about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend, just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music
The fronting, you can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not, I could kill you man
For being false, plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous
Because I've been here since Strictly Business
The era of Eric B. and Rakim, Biz
Public Enemy, Run-DMC, Whodini
The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
LL, when he was rockin bells
Sucker, which fake emcee is rearranging the structure
Ban the motherfucker
And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind
So stay real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

Yes, I'm back, Black, for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of an MC hardcore style type of human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know? Because MTV shows it
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots, the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees
And wannabes that's worst than the AIDS disease
So wake up like a Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead, get to the point (word 'em up)
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom!
Peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic
The only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

Peace, and I;m outta here
Def Squad
Nineteen-nineties
Melo in the house, word
To the fucking year 2000
3000, word up!There's too much
That I keep to myself
And I turn my back on my faith
It's like glass
When we break
I wish no one in my place

And I've seen
You don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep

I can't stay
In this place
I can't stand
When the room turns round
On my fate
You give no guarantees
There's no promise
I can keep
I can't stand
I can't see my way
I feel blind
On my feet
I can't stay too long
Am I wrong?
 (x6)
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck

I'm so tired
Of my mood
And sleep comes
With a knife, fork and a spoon
You're so pale
In your face
You let life
Get in your way

Am I wrong?
 (x4)
Goodbye, lay the blame on luckYou say it's cold back there in Denver
A foot of new snow on the ground
You're all bundled up in blankets
I'd give anything to be there with you now
I'd cover you in kisses
Hold you in my arms
That's all that I can think of
Every minute we're apart
Darlin' I've been livin'
For the moment that we touch
So I can cover you in kisses
And wrap you in my love
Baby keep that fire burnin'
Pour a glass of that sweet wine
Let your hair down on your shoulders
And I'll be there just in time
To cover you in kisses
Hold you in my arms
That's all that I can think of
Every minute we're apart
Darlin' I've been livin'
For the moment that we touch
So I can cover you in kisses
And wrap you in my love
Darlin' I've been livin'
For the moment that we touch
So I can cover you in kisses
And wrap you in my love
I wanna cover you in kisses
And wrap you in my loveWhat?
You say what?
The president did what?
Ah man, that's hey, that's all good baby
He got rid of the player haters too?
Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday
We gonna call this Players Holiday
Ant B-Z what up man?

Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday
1 - Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be a lovely day
2 - Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
Short Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Got some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never
Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days
Repeat 2

Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks
Mac Mall do it big on a Players Holiday, yeahTomorrow will come and girl I can't wait it's our anniversary

It's our anniversary, made for you and meOoh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you
I remember the day
It was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day
I felt fine
Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said theyre leaving
And now I'm torn all apart
I think I'll never forget that day
And for you, girl
This is all I have to say
Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you
I had a dream
Me, myself and I
You were my girl
And of course I was your guy
We were together forever in love for life
And now it don't seem so very nice
Forever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down
You kept me on my feet
Now today all I have to say
Take it out, girl
And try to find a way
Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you
Believe it or not
I can't get over you
You are my everything
What a dream come true
What I feel for you is really hard to explain
I'm in love, girl
I'll never feel the same
You and me can save our love
We'll be together one day
Like hand in glove
All I have to say is
I'll wait forever and a day
Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you
Wait a minute, fellas
This has gotta be a dream
You know
I'm so used to seeing her every single day
My life will never be the same
I know it seems like we just met
And now shes leaving
I'll never find another girl like her
You think if we keep singing this song
She'll hear it on the radio and come back?
Hey guys, I definitely think it's worth a try
Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over youAs days go by in a rush
You've forgotten why you exist
And you are unaware of the problems
You've caused
You want to laugh
You want to have fun
Life is tough as is
That's why
You want music to entertain you
To whisk you away from reality
But we believe that music can bring about change
Come with us
Shall we begin?
 (Nature)
At the time of Genghis Khan the price of washin' your hands in a river was death
We migrated and decayed spewing trash we've ended up fuckin' up our three seas
The unpredictable ruffian he breathes exhaust gas and he's now having a barbecue!
Forests on fire
Mother Nature weeping blood
Arrogance at an all time high!
Factory chimneys belch smoke
Nuclear reactors, hazardous waste
"Electro smoke" is always on the go
The biggest parasite is man just look at the planet!
Man isn't even as capable as animals
He changed things up, then couldn't adapt
The bill is for the next generation to pay
Doomsday's upon us, watch like an imbecile!
 (Drought)
Don't do it!
Don't toss cigarette butts in the sea
You can't take it back
There'll come a day when that trash-filled sea
Will be missed, but it won't be there!
Not long before we go barren like Africa
Children growing up without water
Because we destroyed our lakes, rivers, streams, everything!
No mercy?
I can't believe it
We've taken it all for granted
Animals have their stomachs filled with plastic
Doesn't it break your heart?
Retweeting isn't enough
Something must be done
Do not pollute the water!
Let my land be serene like water
Don't inject no poison into its veins!

Come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notice
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
Don't be afraid come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notic
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
 (Law)
I am a "White Turk"
My laws are Anglo-Saxon but my mind is Middle-Eastern
I grew up apolitical
I never voted
I've cared about holidays, traveling and debts
Justice is dead
I stayed silent and participated until it was me
Now I'm too scared to send a tweet
I've come to fear my own country's police
Sorry to say, but this hopeless generation is your creation
The unhappy faction is your creation and this gunfire!
Innocent men rotting in jail without even knowing why
It's all you!
This horrifying picture is your creation this tired voice of mine
Idiot MPs, corrupt leeches, building their wealth on the back of the poor, using their taxes
It's all you!
You've never encountered death, never once lost your breath
A coffee expert, always a cup in your hand
All you care about is your wannabe "Startup"
Now, the justice that was supposed to protect you will come knocking, will break down your door!
You've acquitted child-killers just because they are cops you didn't say a word, which means you're guilty!
Because you mourned for two days, and moved on
You forgot the name of the judge
Who released Tugce and Busra's killers!
If something happens to you, will you rely on the law?
If they falsely arrest you one night, no single journalist can report it because they're all locked up!
The lives taken by released killers (They won't come back)
Wasted years in prison on a false charge (They won't come back)
You stayed silent
You were overpowered because you were quiet
They took away your rights and they won't give them back voluntarily!
 (Justice)
Justice is supposedly the pillar of a country
It's turned a deaf ear, won't listen to you
Traditions, morals, customs
If the one before was bad, tell me, is the incumbent any better?
Is this civilized?
We can't even afford what your dog won't eat
Your police can't pull out his gun and shoot whoever he wants in broad daylight!
Media, press, law, military they all work for you
Young boys are out there at the crack of dawn putting their lives on the line
Hate is your weapon!
These aren't even our sins to pay for
Your plan is all nice!
I don't know who buys this
But I do know this
Our weapon are our words!
 (Law)
I'm the voice of the lost generation
I can't be censored in a flawed picture
To get my team out of this grave I always slept with one eye open
Sticks, knives, they're all ineffective!
A sharp mind is my prime objective
As patience devoured my brain the ones who rained down on me, I set aflame!
All I did was make music!
The police took offense and took me in
I'm at another hearing while you go to your gig
Wearing the same old suit for the past ten years
The day someone tells me all is not for nothing will be the day I'll give my heart and my soul
The judiciary comes and collects its dues
In hell I'm living, my body is burning
 (Turkey)
Hello Turkey (3B)
I have an ID (T.C.)
We're trying to get by without getting in harm's way
The charlatan on TV, always a fanatic devotee!
Maliciousness is an epidemic, continues to manipulate!
This is all a charade!
We're flying into turbulence!
Syria was our neighbor, now are they our citizens? (Fellow countrymen?)
Even the dead aren't at peace, we're cursed by them
"Hurriyet" was just a newspaper
You go be as free as you can be!
 (Istanbul)
Swallows us whole in a single bite
All-devouring Istanbul!
Chipping away at the best of times
It's an elusive mystery!
Its streets are paved with gold
You gave your hand, it grabbed your arm (get 'em!)
Transport, education, judiciary (help!)
The devil's spread his poison!
Money is a must or having contacts is a must
The big guys having your number is a must
Having an insider in Aksaray is a must
We never owned a yacht, a flat or a mansion
Our piggy banks were never full
I wasn't born rich
You must have a purpose in the big city
You didn't produce anything, yet you burned down forests!
You've become an animal in the concrete jungle
You've got dark circles under your eyes again
Dinosaurs are in power
There's a role for everyone in this jungle
"Stay silent and you will be next"
"Bright minds are facing a dark future next!"
 (Education)
I will graduate!
I'll give you cash, you give me a diploma
No money, I must work up a sweat
Equal opportunity in education is what I exploit as a college student
I graduated
I'm a drifter because of the system you created
I graduated
I'll be a cashier or I'll be your usher at the movies!
Universities everywhere but village schools are in dire need
Whatever ideology the higher-ups have is what is taught in class
Rich, poor separated favored according to their money or backing
Education is an industry the same as making illegal profit from construction!
One doesn't have money for books
A budding teacher who doesn't know "the right people"
You know an MP? Wow!
You'll never get me if that's how you roll!
At least help out a village school
Chaos everywhere
You should fight too!
The kid barely slept tonight
He will go to school build him a road!
 (Curiosity)
Why this sky?
These stars, these galaxies, the planets...
Why?
What makes this universe?
What makes the Earth?
Why me? Why you? Why us? Ask!
First of all, ask "Why do I exist?
"Where did I come from and why am I human?
How did I? How did we? How does everything?
How did we add meaning? How do we learn?
What does life favor? Who gets the grace?
"Who gets to eat?"
To understand, to explain and comprehend?
Is it forbidden to understand?
Could be, but there isn't one answer!
There are many, go seek them out!
Chase it, make sure to look for proof!
Feed your soul, keep looking for fuel!
Protect your heart and find a witness
Take a breath and pursue art!
Ask, ask about the atoms
Think of the speed of light and go get yourself wings
And then... Fly!
Fly as high as you can!
Fly as high as you can fly!
Let yourself go!
 (Women's Rights)
I wouldn't know
I've never had to defend myself
I wouldn't know, I've never had to worry about a child
I've never been forced to marry
There was no abuse in my home
In my own home I've never been imprisoned in my room
I've never been indoctrinated
I've never been displaced
I've never been burned with hatred
I was never burned to death
I never had siblings
I've never been afraid of my older brother
I've never been pulled out of school
I've never been murdered!
 (Violence Against Women)
You never lay your hands on a woman, you idiot!
You're a sorry excuse for a human being!
She deserves the best
Say "No to violence against women!"
Why are the males at the top of the pyramid?
In traffic, at home or in public transportation?
The harassments never end
A slap on the wrist doesn't cut it
Uh, ah, are these moneybags your idea of a "Man"?
Slapped her five times in Beşiktaş, nasty
Pockets full of money, heart worthless
Where's your head at? Are you even human?
Secondhand embarrassment! Are you even human?
Are you even human?
How do you even get to this point? How?
 (World)
Let this world spin like my head is spinning
As I lose my mind
A dream
My breath, my inner voice
I fall into the deep
Let this world spin like my head is spinning
As I lose my mind
A dream
My breath, my inner voice
I fall into the deep
 (Foreign Lands)
They banged my head against a wall
They put out cigarettes on my skin instead of protecting me
They made me get up
The smell of burnt skin and smoke
Bastinado, "motherfucker"
Is that the due process here?
According to which rule?
I'm ready for battle, there will be chaos
This is what is taught, loving violence and fanning the flames
Germany is as cold as ice, let me tell you
Most of the youth are on Amphetamines Tilidine" or "Weed", "Cocaine" or "Speed", "Crack"
You might like it but it's not my cup of tea
Not my cup of tea!
Walk as you please! Step on a mine and die
And for what cost?
How much is it?
Stop rolling around like a wheel
Just be my friend
If you're talking, be honest!
 (Animal Rights)
A bowl of water, is that too much to ask?
Have a conscience, damn it!
You don't want to understand but their lives are entrusted to you and me
Think for once!
"You're living alone, outside, in the cold, in winter
Nobody speaks your language
Danger everywhere
Always disaster, always calamity!"
They can't win, they are the wounded
Whatever they do, it's never enough for you
It's about compassion, not money!
Abandoning them in the woods is not the answer!
They're not wolves, they can't survive on their own there
Protect them
They can't fight for their own rights
The shelters are full
The territory is harsh
Its sky is dark
The punishment is money for raping and torturing stray animals
"Major immorality requires major imbeciles"
Not all humans are guilty but all animals are innocent!

Come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notic
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
Don't be afraid come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notic
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
 (Suicide)
Don't go! (Don't go)
There's still a lot we can change in this life
Don't be stubborn!
We all gave up at some point in time
Now clench your fist
Put an end to your silence
Remember how strong you stood when you blew a fuse!
Hate inside, hate outside
Come!
Love life the most
I can't create a world for you but I will definitely hold your hand
Don't leave the world even if everyone leaves you
I'm not judging you
I will never fully understand your pain
I know
If it's too heavy, I leave it behind I walk down my own path
Please look at the mirror say "I love you"
 (Fascism)
Ey! What is fascism?
To put it roughly, we will be deceived
All of us, together
All you know is "you"
Many accidents caused by overambition
This ambition is an everlasting emotion
Snap at your wife at home
Crisis on the street
Shh!
Kick a dog, not the purebred, but the mutt, brainless!
Ey! A thief who steals from himself
Fear the police, ey!
The "System" wants you to be a nobody, a raw, and shallow, individual
Know what is what and know us
We're the generation that looks dirty but has clean hands
You are the seat of the bike while we are the wheels and the handlebars
Ey! Naturally, we want a generation like ours
Ey! This is our main goal, respect is all
Grandchild, be a mirror!
Anxiety galore but this is our road
Drown or be born
So many wrongs, as many rights
So be it, grandchild
Respect is all!
 (Street)
I can't look you in the eyes, my face falls
Barefoot but dreams in their eyes
Timid but he still puts in the work
He's spent
Look! Every day is an exile!
He can't escape, bullies chase him
They look for a helping hand
Burn the big shot's money and go knock that fuckin' ego out
Don't name streets after ministers, but after the poor and the orphans
Don't interfere with the street vendors, send the officers to the skyscrapers

I'm a branch broken off by the storm
Been around a lot and fraying
So much goes on inside me
There are no words if I tried to explain
Sometimes I'm the story of a homeless child
I'm a branch broken off by the storm
Been around a lot and fraying
So much goes on inside me
There are no words if I tried to explain
Sometimes I'm the story of a homeless child
 (Traffic)
A death trap
Highways are death traps
365 days at risk
Countless ruffians with no conscience
Pay hush money
A car accident overshadow the holidays
Broken hearts, so much pain
A requiem rings in their ears, the wound never heals
Alcohol, violence, and speed cause terror
Kids driving expensive sports cars have no fear
Safety first, leniency next
Patience, peace, man needs these
The smallest of mistakes can ruin everything
Believe me, there's no return!Set the night to music
Set the night to music
Look at all the stars tonight, look at all the moonlight
Look at us we're all alone
Oh and it's just like a dream, some romantic fantasy
Darling come and hold, hold me close
We could be making love
And with the slightest touch
We could, set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music
Find a rhythm all our own, melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here
Your heart beating next to mine, perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world disappear
This moment is ours to take (this moment is ours)
And with the love we make
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
This moment is ours to take (this moment is ours)
And with the love we make
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you
To set the night, set the night
Set the night to music
Set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
Set the night, set the night, set the night, set the night...My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
"I'm gonna be like you, Dad"
"You know, I'm gonna be like you"

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?", "Son, I don't know when"
"We'll get together then"
"You know we'll have a good time then"

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play"
"Could you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today"
"I got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay"
And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
"You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah"
"You know I'm gonna be like him"

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?", "Son, I don't know when"
"We'll get together then"
"You know we'll have a good time then"

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
"I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?"
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys"
"See you later. Can I have them, please?"

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?", "Son, I don't know when"
"We'll get together then"
"You know we'll have a good time then"

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
"I'd like to see you, if you don't mind"
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time"
"You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu"
"But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you"
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?", "Son, I don't know when"
"We'll get together then"
"You know we'll have a good time then"
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?", "Son, I don't know when"
"We'll get together then"
"You know we'll have a good time then"That old dog has chained you up all right
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you
Come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good
Don't say you'll stay
'Cause then you go away

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks
For me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits

I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

Let's don't forget about it (hey no no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (hey hey hey)This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time

Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, alwaysI don't know where my baby is

Guilt, Bad Conscience, and Related Matters
1
To breed an animal that is entitled to make promises—is that not precisely the paradoxical task nature has set itself where human beings are concerned? Isn’t that the real problem of human beings? . . . The fact that this problem has to a great extent been solved must seem all the more astonishing to a person who knows how to appreciate fully the power which works against this promise-making, namely forgetfulness. Forgetfulness is not merely a vis interiae , as superficial people think. Is it much rather an active capability to repress, something positive in the strongest sense, to which we can ascribe the fact that while we are digesting what we alone live through and experience and absorb into ourselves (we could call the process mental ingestion ), we are conscious of what is going  on as little as we are with the entire thousand-fold process which our bodily nourishment goes through (so-called physical ingestion ). The doors and windows of consciousness are shut temporarily; they remain undisturbed by the noise and struggle with which the underworld of our functional organs keeps working for and against one another; a little stillness, a little tabula rasa  of the consciousness, so that there will again be room for something new, above all, for the nobler functions and officials, for ruling, thinking ahead, determining what to do (for our organism is arranged as an oligarchy)—that is, as I said, the use of active forgetfulness, a porter at the door, so to speak, a custodian of psychic order, quiet, etiquette.  From that we can see at once how, if forgetfulness were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic (and not just compare)—he is “finished” with nothing. . . . Now, this particular animal, which is necessarily forgetful, in which forgetfulness is present as a force, as a form of strong health, has had an opposing capability bred into it, a memory, with the help of which, in certain cases, forgetfulness will cease to function—that is, for those cases where promises are to be made. This is in no way a merely passive inability ever to be rid of an impression once it has been etched into the mind, nor is it merely indigestion over a word one has pledged at a particular time  and which one can no longer be over and done with. No, it’s an active wish not to be free of the matter again, an ongoing and continuing desire for what one willed at a particular time, a real memory of one’s will, so that between the original “I will,” “I will do,” and the actual discharge of the will, its action, a world of strange new things, circumstances, even acts of the will can be interposed without a second thought and not break this long chain of the will. But how much all that presupposes! In order to organize the future in this manner, human beings must have first learned to separate necessary events from chance events, to think in terms of cause and effect, to see distant events as if they were present, to anticipate them, to set goals and the means to reach them with certainty, to develop a capability for figures and calculations in general—and for that to occur, a human being must necessarily have first himself become something one could predict, something bound by regular rules, even in the way he imagined himself to himself, so that finally he is able to act like someone who makes promises—he can make himself into a pledge for the future!
2
Precisely that development is the long history of the origin of responsibility. That task of breeding an animal which is permitted to make promises contains within it, as we have already grasped, as a condition and prerequisite, the more precise task of first making a human being necessarily uniform to some extent, one among others like him, regular and consequently predictable. The immense task involved in this, what I have called the “morality of custom” (cf. Daybreak 9, 14, 16)—the essential work of a man on his own self in the longest-lasting age of the human race, his entire prehistorical work, derives its meaning, its grand justification, from the following point, no matter how much hardship, tyranny, monotony, and idiocy it also manifested: with the help of the morality of custom and the social strait jacket, the human being was made truly predictable. Let’s position ourselves, by contrast, at the end of this immense process, in the place where the tree at last yields its fruit, where society and the morality of custom finally bring to light the end for which they were simply the means: then we find, as the ripest fruit on that tree, the sovereign individual, something which resembles only itself, which has broken loose again from the morality of custom, the autonomous individual beyond morality (for “autonomous” and “moral” are mutually exclusive terms), in short, the human being who possesses his own independent and enduring will, who is entitled to make promises—and in him a consciousness quivering in every muscle, proud of what has finally been achieved and has become a living embodiment in him, a real consciousness of power and freedom, a feeling of completion for human beings generally. This man who has become free, who really is entitled to make promises, this master of free will, this sovereign—how is he not to realize the superiority he enjoys over everything which is not permitted to make a promise and make pledges on its own behalf, knowing how much trust, how much fear, and how much respect he creates—he “is worthy” of all three—and how, with this mastery over himself, he has necessarily been given in addition mastery over his circumstances, over nature, and over all less reliable creatures with a shorter will? The “free” man, the owner of an enduring unbreakable will, by possessing this, also acquires his own standard of value: he looks out from himself at others and confers respect or contempt. And just as it will be necessary for him to honour those like him, the strong and dependable (who are entitled to make promises)—in other words, everyone who makes promises like a sovereign, seriously, rarely, and slowly, who is sparing with his trust, who honours another when he does trust, who gives his word as something reliable, because he knows he is strong enough to remain upright even when opposed by misfortune, even when “opposed by fate”—in just the same way it will be necessary for him to keep his foot ready to kick the scrawny unreliable men, who make promises without being entitled to, and to hold his cane ready for the liar, who breaks his word in the very moment it comes out of his mouth. The proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of responsibility, the consciousness of this rare freedom, of this power over oneself and destiny, has become internalized into the deepest parts of him and grown instinctual, has become an instinct, a dominating instinct:—what will he call it, this dominating instinct, assuming that he finds he needs a word for it? There’s no doubt: the sovereign man calls this instinct his conscience.
3
His conscience? . . . To begin with, we can conjecture that the idea “conscience,” which we are encountering here in its highest, almost perplexing form, has a long history and changing developmental process behind it already. To be entitled to pledge one’s word, and to do it with pride, and also to be permitted to say “Yes” to oneself—that is a ripe fruit, as I have mentioned, but it is also a late fruit:—for what a long stretch of time this fruit must have hung tart and sour on the tree! And for an even much longer time it was impossible to see any such fruit—no one could have promised it would appear, even if everything about the tree was certainly getting ready for it and growing in that very direction!—“How does one create a memory for the human animal? How does one stamp something like that into this partly dull, partly flickering, momentary understanding, this living embodiment of forgetfulness, so that it stays current?” . . .  This ancient problem, as you can imagine, was not resolved right away with tender answers and methods. Indeed, there is perhaps nothing more fearful and more terrible in the entire prehistory of human beings than the technique for developing his memory. “We burn something in so that it remains in the memory. Only something which never ceases to cause pain remains in the memory”—that is a leading principle of the most ancient (unfortunately also the longest) psychology on earth. We might even say that everywhere on earth nowadays where there is still solemnity, seriousness, mystery, and gloomy colours in the lives of men and people, something of that terror continues its work, the fear with which in earlier times everywhere on earth people made promises, pledged their word, made a vow. The past, the longest, deepest, most severe past, breathes on us and surfaces in us when we become “solemn.” When the human being considered it necessary to make a memory for himself, it never happened without blood, martyrs, and sacrifices, the most terrible sacrifices and pledges (among them the sacrifice of the first born), the most repulsive self-mutilations (for example, castration), the cruellest forms of ritual in all the religious cults (and all religions are in their deepest foundations systems of cruelty)—all that originates in that instinct which discovered in pain the most powerful means of helping to develop the memory. In a certain sense all asceticism belongs here: a couple of ideas are to be made indissoluble, omnipresent, unforgettable, “fixed,” in order to hypnotize the entire nervous and intellectual system through these “fixed ideas”—and the ascetic procedures and forms of life are the means whereby these ideas are freed from jostling around with all the other ideas, in order to make them “unforgettable.” The worse humanity’s “memory” was, the more terrible its customs have always appeared. The harshness of the laws of punishment, in particular, provide a standard for measuring how much trouble people went to in order to triumph over forgetfulness and to maintain a present awareness of a few primitive demands of social living together for this slave of momentary feelings and desires. We Germans certainly do not think of ourselves as an especially cruel and hard-hearted people, even less as particularly careless people who live only in the present. But just take a look at our old penal code in order to understand how much trouble it takes on this earth to breed a “People of Thinkers” (by that I mean the European people among whom today we still find a maximum of trust, seriousness, tastelessness, and practicality, and who, with these characteristics, have a right to breed all sorts of European mandarins). These Germans have used terrible means to make themselves a memory in order to attain mastery over their vulgar basic instincts and their brutal crudity: think of the old German punishments, for example, stoning (—the legend even lets the mill stone fall on the head of the guilty person), breaking on the wheel (the most characteristic invention and specialty of the German genius in the realm of punishment!), impaling on a stake, ripping people apart or stamping them to death with horses (“quartering”), boiling the criminal in oil or wine (still done in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries), the well-loved practice of flaying (“cutting flesh off in strips”), carving flesh out of the chest, and probably covering the offender with honey and leaving him to the flies in the burning sun. With the help of such images and procedures people finally retained five or six “I will not’s” in the memory, and, so far as these precepts were concerned, they gave their word in order to live with the advantages of society—and it’s true! With the assistance of this sort of memory people finally came to “reason”!—Ah, reason, seriousness, mastery over emotions, this whole gloomy business called reflection, all these privileges and showpieces of human beings: how expensive they were! How much blood and horror is at the bottom of all “good things”! . . .
4
But then how did that other “gloomy business,” the consciousness of guilt, the whole “bad conscience” come into the world?—And with this we turn back to our genealogists of morality. I’ll say it once more—or have I not said anything about it yet?—they are useless. With their own merely “modern” experience extending through only a brief period , with no knowledge of and no desire to know the past, even less a historical instinct, a “second sight”— something necessary at this very point—they nonetheless pursue the history of morality. That must justifiably produce results which have a less than tenuous relationship to the truth. Have these genealogists of morality up to now allowed themselves to dream, even remotely, that, for instance, that major moral principle “guilt”  derived its origin from the very materialistic idea “debt” ? Or that punishment developed as a repayment, completely without reference to any assumption about freedom or lack of freedom of the will?—and did so, by contrast, to the point where it always first required a high degree of human development so that the animal “man” began to make those much more primitive distinctions between “intentional,” “negligent,” “accidental,” “responsible,” and their opposites and bring them to bear when meting out punishment? That idea, nowadays so trite, apparently so natural, so unavoidable, which has even had to serve as the explanation how the feeling of justice in general came into existence on earth, “The criminal deserves punishment because he could have acted otherwise,” this idea is, in fact, an extremely late achievement, indeed, a sophisticated form of human judgment and decision making. Anyone who moves this idea back to the beginnings is sticking his coarse fingers inappropriately into the psychology of older humanity. For the most extensive period of human history, punishment was certainly not meted out because people held the instigator of evil responsible for his actions, and thus it was not assumed that only the guilty party should be punished:—it was much more as it still is now when parents punish their children out of anger over some harm they have suffered, anger vented on the perpetrator—but anger restrained and modified through the idea that every injury has some equivalent and that compensation for it could, in fact, be paid out, even if that is through the pain of the perpetrator. Where did this primitive, deeply rooted, and perhaps by now ineradicable idea derive its power, the idea of an equivalence between punishment and pain? I have already given away the answer: in the contractual relationship between creditor and debtor, which is, in general, as ancient as the idea of “legal subject” and which, for its part, refers back to the basic forms of buying, selling, bartering, trading, and exchanging goods.
5
It’s true that recalling this contractual relationship arouses, as we might initially expect from what I have observed above, all sorts of suspicion of and opposition to older humanity, which established or allowed it. It’s at this particular moment that people make promises. At this very point the pertinent issue is to create a memory for the person who makes a promise, so that precisely here, we can surmise, there will exist a place for harshness, cruelty, and pain. In order to inspire trust in his promise to pay back, in order to give his promise a guarantee of its seriousness and sanctity, in order to impress on his own conscience the idea of paying back as a duty, an obligation, the debtor, by virtue of a contract, pledges to the creditor, in the event that he does not pay, something else that he still “owns,” something else over which he still exercises power, for example, his body or his woman or his freedom or even his life (or, under certain religious conditions, even his blessedness, the salvation of his soul, finally even his peace in the grave, as was the case in Egypt, where the dead body of the debtor even in the tomb found no peace from the creditor—and among the Egyptians, in particular, such peace certainly mattered). That means that the creditor could inflict all kinds of ignominy and torture on the body of the debtor, for instance, slice off the body as much as seemed appropriate for the size of the debt:—and this point of view early on and everywhere gave rise to precise, sometimes horrific estimates going into the smallest detail, legally established estimates about individual limbs and body parts. I consider it already a step forward, as evidence of a freer conception of the law, something which calculates more grandly, a more Roman idea of justice, when Rome’s Twelve Tables of Laws decreed it was all the same, no matter how much or how little the creditor cut off in such cases: “let it not be thought a crime if they cut off more or less.”* Let us clarify for ourselves the logic of this whole method of compensation—it is weird enough. The equivalency is given in this way: instead of an advantage making up directly for the harm (hence, instead of compensation in gold, land, possessions of some sort or another), the creditor is given a kind of pleasure as repayment and compensation—the pleasure of being allowed to discharge his power on a powerless person without having to think about it, the delight in “de fair le mal pour le plaisir de le faire” , the enjoyment of violation. This enjoyment is more highly prized the lower and baser the creditor stands in the social order, and it can easily seem to him a delicious mouthful, in fact, a foretaste of a higher rank. By means of the “punishment” of the debtor, the creditor participates in a right belonging to the masters. Finally he also for once comes to the lofty feeling of despising a being as someone “beneath him,” as someone he is entitled to mistreat—or at least, in the event that the real force of punishment, of executing punishment, has already been transferred to the “authorities,” the feeling of seeing the debtor despised and mistreated. The compensation thus consists of an order for and a right to cruelty.
6
In this area, that is, in the laws of obligation, the world of the moral concepts “guilt,” “conscience,” “duty,” and “sanctity of obligation” has its origin—its beginning, like the beginning of everything great on earth, was watered thoroughly and for a long time with blood. And can we not add that this world deep down has never again been completely free of a certain smell of blood and torture—(not even with old Kant whose categorical imperative stinks of cruelty)? In addition, here that weird knot linking the ideas of “guilt and suffering,” which perhaps has become impossible to undo, was first knit together. Let me pose the question once more: to what extent can suffering be a compensation for “debts”? To the extent that making someone suffer provides the highest degree of pleasure, to the extent that the person hurt by the debt, in exchange for the injury as well as for the distress caused by the injury, got an extraordinary offsetting pleasure: creating suffering—a real celebration, something that, as I’ve said, was valued all the more, the greater it contradicted the rank and social position of the creditor. I have been speculating here, for it’s difficult to see through to the foundations of such subterranean things, quite apart from the fact that it’s embarrassing. And anyone who crudely throws into the middle of all this the idea of “revenge” has buried and dimmed his insights rather than illuminated them (—revenge itself, in fact, simply takes us back to the same problem: “How can making someone suffer give us a feeling of satisfaction?”). It seems to me that the delicacy and, even more, the Tartufferie  of tame house pets (I mean modern man, I mean us) resist imagining with all our power how much cruelty contributes to the great celebratory joy of older humanity, as, in fact, an ingredient mixed into almost all their enjoyments and, from another perspective, how naive, how innocent, their need for cruelty appears, how they fundamentally think of its particular “disinterested malice” (or to use Spinoza’s words, the sympathia malevolens ) as a normal human characteristic:—and hence as something to which their conscience says a heartfelt Yes!* A more deeply penetrating eye might still notice, even today, enough of this most ancient and most fundamental celebratory human joy. In Beyond Good and Evil, 229 (even earlier in Daybreak, 18, 77, 113), I pointed a cautious finger at the constantly growing spiritualization and “deification” of cruelty, which runs through the entire history of higher culture (and, in a significant sense, even constitutes that culture). In any case, it’s not so long ago that people wouldn’t think of an aristocratic wedding and folk festival in the grandest style without executions, tortures, or something like an auto-da-fé , and similarly no noble household lacked creatures on whom people could vent their malice and cruel taunts without a second thought (—remember, for instance, Don Quixote at the court of the duchess; today we read all of Don Quixote with a bitter taste on the tongue; it’s almost an ordeal. In so doing, we would become very foreign, very obscure to the author and his contemporaries—they read it with a fully clear conscience as the most cheerful of books. They almost died laughing at it). Watching suffering makes people feel good; creating suffering makes them feel even better—that’s a harsh principle, but an old, powerful, and human, all-too-human major principle, which, by the way, even the apes might perhaps agree with as well. For people say that, in thinking up bizarre cruelties, the apes already anticipate a great many human actions and are, as it were, an “audition.” Without cruelty there is no celebration: that’s what the oldest and longest human history teaches us—and with punishment, too, there is so much celebration!
7
With these ideas, by the way, I have no desire whatsoever to give our pessimists grist for their discordant mills grating with weariness of life. On the contrary, I want to state very clearly that in that period when human beings had not yet become ashamed of their cruelty, life on earth was happier than it is today, now that we have our pessimists. The darkening of heaven over men’s heads has always increased alarmingly in proportion to the growth of human beings’ shame before human beings. The tired, pessimistic look, the mistrust of the riddle of life, the icy denial stemming from disgust with life—these are not the signs of the wickedest eras of human beings. It’s much more the case that they first come to light as the swamp plants they are when the swamp to which they belong is there—I mean the sickly mollycoddling and moralizing, thanks to which the animal “man” finally learns to feel shame about all his instincts. On his way to becoming an “angel” (not to use a harsher word here), man cultivated for himself that upset stomach and that furry tongue which not only made the joy and innocence of the animal repulsive but also made life itself distasteful:—so that now and then he stands there before himself, holds his nose, and with Pope Innocent III disapproves and makes a catalogue of his nastiness (“conceived in filth, disgustingly nourished in his mother’s body, developed out of evil material stuff, stinking horribly, a secretion of spit, urine, and excrement”).* Now, when suffering always has to march out as the first among the arguments against existence, as its most serious question mark, it’s good for us to remember the times when people judged things the other way around, because they couldn’t do without making people suffer and saw a first-class magic  in it, a really tempting enticement for living.  Perhaps, and let me say this as a consolation for the delicate, at that time pain did not yet hurt as much as it does nowadays. That at least could be the conclusion of a doctor who had treated a Negro (taking the latter as a representative of prehistorical man) for a bad case of inner inflammation, which drives the European, even one with the best constitution, almost to despair, but which does not have the same effect on the Negro. (The graph of the human sensitivity to pain seems in fact to sink down remarkably and almost immediately after one has moved beyond the first ten thousand or ten million of the top members of the higher culture. And I personally have no doubt that, in comparison with one painful night of a single hysterical well-educated female, the total suffering of all animals which up to now have been interrogated by the knife in search of scientific answers is simply not worth considering). Perhaps it is even permissible to concede the possibility that that pleasure in cruelty does not really need to have died out. It would only require a certain sublimation and subtlety, in proportion to the way pain hurts more nowadays; in other words, it would have to appear translated into the imaginative and spiritual and embellished with nothing but names so unobjectionable that they arouse no suspicion in even the most delicate hypocritical conscience (“tragic pity” is one  such name; another is “les nostalgies de la croix” ). What truly enrages people about suffering is not the suffering itself, but the meaninglessness of suffering. But neither for the Christian, who has interpreted into suffering an entire secret machinery for salvation, nor for the naive men of older times, who understood how to interpret all suffering in relation to the spectator or to the person inflicting the suffering, was there generally any such meaningless suffering. In order for the hidden, undiscovered, unwitnessed suffering to be removed from the world and for people to be able to deny it honestly, they were then almost compelled to invent gods and intermediate beings at all levels, high and low—briefly put, something that also roamed in hidden places, that also looked into the darkness, and that would not readily permit an interesting painful spectacle to escape its attention. For with the help of such inventions life then understood and has always understood how to justify itself by a trick, how to justify its “evil.” Nowadays perhaps it requires other helpful inventions for that purpose (for example, life as riddle, life as a problem of knowledge). “Every evil a glimpse of which edifies a god is justified”: that’s how the prehistorical logic of feeling rang out—and was that really confined only to prehistory? The gods conceived of as friends of cruel spectacle—O how widely this primitive idea still rises up even within our European humanity! We might well seek advice from, say, Calvin and Luther on this point. At any rate it is certain that even the Greeks knew of no more acceptable snack to offer their gods to make them happy than the joys of cruelty. With what sort of expression, do you think, did Homer allow his gods to look down on the fates of men? What final sense was there basically in the Trojan War and similar tragic terrors? We cannot entertain the slightest doubts about this: they were intended as celebrations for the gods: and, to the extent that the poet is in these matters more “godlike” than other men, as festivals for the poets as well. . . . Later the Greek moral philosophers in the same way imagined the eyes of god no differently, still looking down on the moral struggles, on heroism and the self-mutilation of the virtuous: the “Hercules of duty” was on a stage, and he knew he was there. Without someone watching, virtue for this race of actors was something entirely inconceivable. Surely such a daring and fateful philosophical invention, first made for Europe at that time, the invention of the “free will,” of the absolutely spontaneous nature of human beings in matters of good and evil, was created above all to justify the idea that the interest of gods in men, in human virtue, could never run out? On this earthly stage there was never to be any lack of really new things, really unheard of suspense, complications, catastrophes. A world conceived of as perfectly deterministic would have been predictable to the gods and therefore also soon boring for them—reason enough for these friends of the gods, the philosophers, not to ascribe such a deterministic world to their gods! All of ancient humanity is full of sensitive consideration for “the spectator,” for a truly public, truly visible world, which did not know how to imagine happiness without dramatic performances and festivals. And, as I have already said, in great punishment there is also so much celebration!

To resume the path of our enquiry, the feeling of guilt, of personal obligation has, as we saw, its origin in the oldest and most primitive personal relationship there is, in the relationship between seller and buyer, creditor and debtor. Here for the first time one person moved up against another person, here an individual measured himself against another individual. We have found no civilization still at such a low level that something of this relationship is not already perceptible. To set prices, to measure values, to think up equivalencies, to exchange things—that preoccupied man’s very first thinking to such a degree that in a certain sense it’s what thinking itself is. Here the oldest form of astuteness was bred; here, too, we can assume are the first beginnings of man’s pride, his feeling of pre-eminence in relation to other animals. Perhaps our word “man” (manas) continues to express directly something of this feeling of the self: the human being describes himself as a being which assesses values, which values and measures, as the “inherently calculating animal.” Selling and buying, together with their psychological attributes, are even older than the beginnings of any form of social organizations and groupings; out of the most rudimentary form of personal legal rights the budding feeling of exchange, contract, guilt, law, duty, and compensation was instead first transferred to the crudest and earliest social structures (in their relationships with similar social structures), along with the habit of comparing power with power, of measuring, of calculating. The eye was now adjusted to this perspective, and with that awkward consistency characteristic of thinking in more ancient human beings, hard to get started but then inexorably moving forward in the same direction, people soon reached the great generalization: “Each thing has its price, everything can be paid off”—the oldest and most naive moral principle of justice, the beginning of all “good nature,” all “fairness,” all “good will,” all “objectivity” on earth. Justice at this first stage is good will among those approximately equal in power to come to terms with each other, to “come to an agreement” again with each other by compensation—and in relation to those less powerful, to compel them to arrive at some settlement among themselves.—

Always measured by the standard of prehistory (a prehistory which, by the way, is present at all times or is capable of returning), the community also stands in relation to its members in that important basic relationship of the creditor to his debtor. People live in a community. They enjoy the advantages of a community (and what advantages they are! Nowadays we sometimes underestimate them); they live protected, cared for, in peace and trust, without worries concerning certain injuries and enmities from which the man outside the community, the “man without peace,” is excluded—a German understands what “misery”  or êlend  originally means—and how people pledged themselves to and entered into obligations with the community bearing in mind precisely these injuries and enmities.  What will happen with an exception to this case? The community, the defrauded creditor, will see that it gets paid as well as it can—on that people can rely. The issue here is least of all the immediate damage which the offender has caused. Setting this to one side, the lawbreaker  is above all a “breaker” , a breaker of contracts and a breaker of his word against the totality, with respect to all the good features and advantages of the communal life in which, up to that point, he has had a share. The lawbreaker is a debtor who does not merely not pay back the benefits and advances given to him, but who even attacks his creditor. So from this point on not only does he forfeit, as is reasonable, all these good things and benefits—but he is also now reminded what these good things are all about. The anger of the injured creditor, the community, gives him back again to the wild outlawed condition, from which he was earlier protected. It pushes him away from itself—and now every form of hostility can vent itself on him. At this stage of cultural behaviour “punishment” is simply the copy, the mimus, of the normal conduct towards the hated, disarmed enemy  who has been thrown down, who has forfeited not only all legal rights and protection but also all mercy; hence it is a case of the rights of war and the victory celebration of vae victis  in all its ruthlessness and cruelty:—which accounts for the fact that war itself (including the warlike cult of sacrifice) has given us all the forms in which punishment has appeared in history.
10
As it acquires more power, a community no longer considers the crimes of the single individual so serious, because it no longer is entitled to consider him as dangerous and unsettling for the existence of the totality as much as it did before. The wrongdoer is no longer “outlawed” and thrown out, and the common anger is no longer permitted to vent itself on him without restraint to the same extent as earlier— instead the wrongdoer from now on is carefully protected by the community against this anger, especially from that of the immediately injured person, and is taken into protective custody. The compromise with the anger of those particularly affected by the wrong doing, and thus the effort to localize the case and to avert a wider or even a general participation and unrest, the attempts to find equivalents and to settle the whole business (the compositio), above all the desire, appearing with ever-increasing clarity, to consider every crime as, in some sense or other, capable of being paid off, and thus, at least to a certain extent, to separate the criminal and his crime from each other—those are the characteristics stamped more and more clearly on the further development of criminal law. If the power and the self-confidence of a community keep growing, the criminal law also grows constantly milder. Every weakening and deeper jeopardizing of the community brings its harsher forms of criminal law to light once again. The “creditor” has always became proportionally more humane as he has become richer. Finally the amount of his wealth even becomes measured by how much damage he can sustain without suffering from it. It would not be impossible to imagine a society with a consciousness of its own power which allowed itself the most privileged luxury which it can have—letting its criminals go without punishment. “Why should I really bother about my parasites?” it could then say. “May they live and prosper; for that I am still sufficiently strong!” . . . Justice, which started with “Everything is capable of being paid for; everything must be paid off” ends at that point, by shutting its eyes and letting the person incapable of payment go free—it ends, as every good thing on earth ends, by doing away with itself. This self-negation of justice: we know what a beautiful name it calls itself—mercy. It goes without saying that mercy remains the privilege of the most powerful man, or even better, his beyond the law.
11
A critical comment here about a recently published attempt to find the origin of justice in a completely different place—that is, in ressentiment. But first a word in the ear of the psychologists, provided that they have any desire to study ressentiment itself up close for once: this plant grows most beautifully nowadays among anarchists and anti-Semites; in addition, it blooms, as it always has, in hidden places, like the violet, although it has a different fragrance.* And since like always has to emerge necessarily from like, it is not surprising to see attempts coming forward again from just such circles, as they have already done many times before—see above, Section 14 —to sanctify revenge under the name of justice—as if justice were basically only a further development of a feeling of being injured—and to bring belated honour to reactive emotions generally, all of them, using the idea of revenge. With this last point I personally take the least offence. It even seems to me a service, so far as the entire biological problem is concerned (in connection with which the worth of those emotions has been underestimated up to now). The only thing I am calling attention to is the fact that it is the very spirit of ressentiment out of which this new emphasis on scientific fairness grows (which favours hate, envy, resentment, suspicion, rancour, and revenge). This “scientific fairness,” that is, ceases immediately and gives way to tones of mortal enmity and prejudice as soon as it deals with another group of emotions which, it strikes me, have a much higher biological worth than those reactive ones and which therefore have earned the right to be scientifically assessed and respected first—namely, the truly active emotions, like desire for mastery, acquisitiveness, and so on (E. Dühring, The Value of Life: A Course in Philosophy, the whole book really).* So much against this tendency in general. But in connection with Dühring’s single principle that we have to seek the homeland of justice in the land of the reactive feeling, we must, for love of the truth, rudely turn this around by setting out a different principle: the last territory to be conquered by the spirit of justice is the land of the reactive emotions! If it is truly the case that the just man remains just even towards someone who has injured him (and not merely cold, moderate, strange, indifferent: being just is always a positive attitude), if under the sudden attack of personal injury, ridicule, and suspicion, the gaze of the lofty, clear objectivity of the just and judging eye, as profound as it is benevolent, does not itself grow dark, well, that’s a piece of perfection and the highest mastery on earth—even something that it would be wise for people not to expect here; in any event, they should not believe in it too easily. It’s certainly true that, on average, among the most just people themselves even a small dose of hostility, malice, and insinuation is enough to make them see red and chase fairness out of their eyes. The active, aggressive, over-reaching human being is still placed a hundred steps closer to justice than the reactive person. For him it is simply not necessary in the slightest to estimate an object falsely and with bias, the way the reactive man does and must do. Thus, as a matter of fact, at all times the aggressive human being, as the stronger, braver, more noble man, has had on his side a better conscience as well as a more independent eye; by contrast, we can already guess who generally has the invention of “bad conscience” on his conscience—the man of ressentiment! Finally, let’s look around in history: up to now in what area has the whole implementation of law in general as well as the essential need for law been at home on earth? Could it be in the area of the reactive human beings? That is entirely wrong. It is much more the case that it’s been at home with the active, strong, spontaneous, and aggressive men. Historically considered, the law on earth—let me say this to the annoyance of the above-mentioned agitator (who once even confessed about himself “The doctrine of revenge runs through all my work and efforts as the red thread of justice”)—represents that very struggle against the reactive feelings, the war with them on the part of active and aggressive powers, which have partly used up their strength to put a halt to or to restrain the excess of reactive pathos and to compel some settlement with it. Wherever justice is practised, wherever justice is upheld, we see a stronger power in relation to a weaker power standing beneath it (whether with groups or individuals), seeking ways to bring an end among the latter to the senseless rage of ressentiment, partly by dragging the object of ressentiment out of the hands of revenge, partly by setting in the place of revenge a battle against the enemies of peace and order, partly by coming up with compensation, proposing it, under certain circumstances making it compulsory, partly by establishing certain equivalents for injuries as a norm, into which from now on ressentiment is directed once and for all. The most decisive factor, however, which the highest power carries out and sets in place against the superior numbers of the feelings of hostility and animosity—something that power always does as soon as it is somehow strong enough to do it—is to set up law, the imperative explanation of those things which, in its own eyes, are generally considered allowed and legal and things which are considered forbidden and illegal, while after the establishment of the law, the authorities treat attacks and arbitrary acts of individuals or entire groups as an outrage against the law, as rebellion against the highest power itself, and they steer the feeling of those beneath them away from the immediate damage caused by such outrages and thus, in the long run, achieve the reverse of what all revenge desires, which sees only the viewpoint of the injured party and considers only that valid. From now on, the eye becomes trained to evaluate actions always impersonally, even the eye of the harmed party itself (although this would be the very last thing to occur, as I have remarked earlier).—Consequently, only with the setting up of the law is there a “just” and “unjust” (and not, as Dühring will have it, from the time of the injurious action). To talk of just and unjust in themselves has no sense whatsoever; it’s obvious that in themselves harming, oppressing, exploiting, destroying cannot be “unjust,” inasmuch as life essentially works that way, that is, in its basic functions it harms, oppresses, exploits, and destroys, and cannot be conceived at all without this character. We have to acknowledge something even more disturbing: the fact that from the highest biological standpoint, conditions of justice must always be only exceptional conditions, partial restrictions on the basic will to live, which is set on power; they are subordinate to the total purpose of this will as individual means, that is, as means to create larger units of power. A legal system conceived of as sovereign and universal, not as a means in the struggle of power complexes, but as a means against all struggles in general, something along the lines of Dühring’s communist cliché in which each will must be considered as equal to every will, that would be a principle hostile to life, a destroyer and dissolver of human beings, an assassination attempt on the future of human beings, a sign of exhaustion, a secret path to nothingness.—

Here one more word concerning the origin and purpose of punishment—two problems which are separate or should be separate. Unfortunately people normally throw them together into one. How do the previous genealogists of morality deal with this issue? Naively—the way they have always worked. They find some “purpose” or other for punishment, for example, revenge or deterrence, then in a simple way set this purpose at the beginning as the causa fiendi  of punishment and—they’re finished. The “purpose in law,” however, is the very last idea we should use in the history of the emergence of law. It is much rather the case that for all forms of history there is no more important principle than that one which we reach with such difficulty but which we also really should reach—namely that what causes a particular thing to arise and the final utility of that thing, its actual use and arrangement in a system of purposes, are separate toto coelo  from each other, that something existing, which has somehow come to its present state, will again and again be interpreted by the higher power over it from a new perspective, appropriated in a new way, reorganized for and redirected to new uses, that all events in the organic world involve overpowering, acquiring mastery and that, in turn, all overpowering and acquiring mastery involve a new interpretation, a readjustment, in which the “sense” and “purpose” up to then must necessarily be obscured or entirely erased. No matter how well we have understood the usefulness of some physiological organ or other (or a legal institution, a social custom, a political practice, some style in the arts or in a religious cult), we have still not, in that process, grasped anything about its origin—no matter how uncomfortable and unpleasant this may sound in elderly ears. From time immemorial people have believed that in demonstrable purposes, in the usefulness of a thing, a form, or an institution, they could also understand the reason it came into existence—the eye as something made to see, the hand as something made to grasp. So people also imagined punishment as invented to punish. But all purposes, all uses, are only signs that a will to power has become master over something with less power and has stamped on it its own meaning of some function, and the entire history of a “thing,” an organ, a practice can by this process be seen as a continuing chain of signs of constantly new interpretations and adjustments, whose causes do not even need to be connected to each other—in some circumstances they rather follow and take over from each other by chance. Consequently, the “development” of a thing, a practice, or an organ has nothing to do with its progressus  towards a single goal, even less is it the logical and shortest progressus reached with the least expenditure of power and resources—but rather the sequence of more or less profound, more or less mutually independent processes of overpowering which take place on that thing, together with the resistance which arises against that overpowering each time, the changes of form which have been attempted for the purpose of defence and reaction, as well as the results of successful counter-measures. Form is fluid; the “meaning,” however, is even more so. . . . Even within each individual organism things are no different: with every essential growth in the totality, the “meaning” of the individual organ also shifts—in certain circumstances its partial destruction, a reduction of its numbers (for example, through the obliteration of intermediate structures) can be a sign of growing power and perfection. What I wanted to say is this: the partial loss of utility, decline, and degeneration, the loss of meaning, and purposiveness, in short, death, also belong to the conditions of a real progressus , which always appears in the form of a will and a way to a greater power and always establishes itself at the expense of a huge number of smaller powers. The size of a “step forward” can even be estimated by a measure of everything that had to be sacrificed to it. The humanity as mass sacrificed for the benefit of a single stronger species of man— that would be a step forward . . . . I emphasize this major point of view about historical methodology all the more since it basically runs counter to the very instinct which presently rules and to contemporary taste, which would rather still go along with the absolute contingency, even the mechanical meaninglessness, of all events rather than with the theory of a will to power playing itself out in everything that happens.  The democratic idiosyncrasy of being hostile to everything which rules and wants to rule, the modern hatred of rulers  (to make up a bad word for a bad thing) has gradually transformed itself into and dressed itself up as something spiritual, of the highest spirituality, to such an extent that nowadays step by step it is already infiltrating the strictest, apparently most objective scientific research, and is allowed to infiltrate it. Indeed, it seems to me already to have attained mastery over all of physiology and the understanding of life, to their detriment, as is obvious, because it has conjured away from them their fundamental concept, that of real activity. By contrast, under the pressure of this idiosyncrasy we push “adaptation” into the foreground, that is, a second-order activity, a mere reactivity; in fact, people have defined life itself as an always purposeful inner adaptation to external circumstances (Herbert Spencer). But that simply misjudges the essence of life, its will to power. That overlooks the first priority of the spontaneous, aggressive, over-reaching, re-interpreting, re-directing, and shaping powers, after whose effects the “adaptation” then follows. Thus, the governing role of the highest functions in an organism itself, the ones in which the will for living appear active and creative, are denied. People should remember the criticism Huxley directed at Spencer for his “administrative nihilism.” But the issue here concerns much more than “administration.” . . .*
13
Returning to the business at hand, that is, to punishment, we have to differentiate between two aspects of it: first its relative duration, the way it is carried out, the action, the “drama,” a certain strict sequence of procedures and, on the other hand, its fluidity, the meaning, the purpose, the expectation linked to the implementation of such procedures. In this matter, we can here assume, without further comment, per analogium , in accordance with the major viewpoints about the historical method we have just established, that the procedure itself will be somewhat older and earlier than its use as a punishment, that the latter was only first injected and interpreted into the procedure (which had been present for a long time but was a custom with a different meaning), in short, that it was not what our naive genealogists of morality and law up to now have assumed, who collectively imagined that the procedure was invented for the purpose of punishment, just as people earlier thought that the hand was invented for the purpose of grasping. Now, so far as that other element in punishment is concerned, the fluid element, its “meaning,” in a very late cultural state (for example in contemporary Europe) the idea of “punishment” actually presents not simply one meaning but a whole synthesis of “meanings.” The history of punishment up to now, in general, the history of its use for different purposes, finally crystallizes into a sort of unity, which is difficult to untangle, difficult to analyze, and, it must be stressed, totally incapable of definition. (Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really punish; all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude definition. Only something which has no history is capable of being defined). At an earlier stage, by contrast, that synthesis of “meanings” still appears easier to untangle, as well as even easier to adjust. We can still see how in every individual case the elements in the synthesis alter their valence and rearrange themselves accordingly, so that soon this or that element steps forward and dominates at the expense of the rest; indeed, under certain circumstances one element (say, the purpose of deterrence) appears to rise above all the other elements. In order to give at least an idea of how uncertain, how belated, how accidental “the meaning” of punishment is and how one and the same procedure can be used, interpreted, or adjusted for fundamentally different purposes, let me offer here an example which presented itself to me on the basis of relatively little random material: punishment as a way of rendering someone harmless, as a prevention from further harm; punishment as compensation for the damage to the person injured, in some form or other (also in the form of emotional compensation); punishment as isolation of some upset to an even balance in order to avert a wider outbreak of the disturbance; punishment as way of inspiring fear of those who determine and carry out punishment; punishment as a sort of compensation for the advantages which the law breaker has enjoyed up until that time (for example, when he is made useful as a slave working in the mines); punishment as a cutting out of a degenerate element (in some circumstances an entire branch, as in Chinese law, and thus a means to keep the race pure or to sustain a social type); punishment as festival, that is, as the violation and humiliation of some enemy one has finally thrown down; punishment as a way of making a conscience, whether for the man who suffers the punishment— so- called “reform”—or whether for those who witness the punishment being carried out; punishment as the payment of an honorarium, set as a condition by those in power, which protects the wrong doer from the excesses of revenge; punishment as a compromise with the natural condition of revenge, insofar as the latter is still upheld and assumed as a privilege by powerful families; punishment as a declaration of war and a war measure against an enemy to peace, law, order, and authority, which people fight with the very measures war makes available, as something dangerous to the community, as a breach of contract with respect to its conditions, as a rebel, traitor, and breaker of the peace.
14
Of course, this list is not complete. Obviously punishment is overloaded with all sorts of useful purposes, all the more reason why people can infer from it an alleged utility, which, in the popular consciousness at least, is considered its most essential one—faith in punishment, which nowadays for several reasons is getting shaky, still finds its most powerful support in precisely that. Punishment is supposed to be valuable in waking the feeling of guilt in the guilty party. In punishment people are looking for the actual instrument for that psychic reaction called “bad conscience,” “pangs of conscience.” But in doing this, people are misappropriating reality and psychology, even for today, and how much more for the longest history of man, his prehistory! Real pangs of conscience are something extremely rare, especially among criminals and prisoners. Prisons and penitentiaries are not breeding grounds in which this species of gnawing worm particularly likes to thrive:—on that point all conscientious observers agree, in many cases delivering such a judgment with sufficient unwillingness, going against their own desires. In general, punishment makes people hard and cold. It concentrates. It sharpens the feeling of estrangement; it strengthens powers of resistance. If it comes about that punishment shatters a man’s energy and brings on a wretched prostration and self-abasement, such a consequence is surely even less pleasant than the typical result of punishment, characteristically a dry, gloomy seriousness. However, if we consider those thousands of years before the history of humanity, without a second thought we can conclude that the very development of a feeling of guilt was most powerfully hindered by punishment—at least with respect to the victims onto whom this force of punishment was vented. For let us not underestimate just how much the criminal is prevented by the very sight of judicial and executive procedures themselves from sensing that his act, the nature of his action, is something inherently reprehensible, for he sees exactly the same kind of actions committed in the service of justice, then applauded and practised in good conscience, like espionage, lying, bribery, entrapment, the whole tricky and sly art of the police and prosecution, as it manifests itself in the various kinds of punishment—the robbery, oppression, abuse, imprisonment, torture, murder, all done, moreover, as a matter of principle, without even any emotional involvement as an excuse— all these actions are in no way rejected or condemned in themselves by his judges, but only in particular respects when used for certain purposes. “Bad conscience,” this most creepy and most interesting plant among our earthly vegetation, did not grow in this soil—in fact, for the longest period in the past nothing about dealing with a “guilty party” penetrated the consciousness of judges or even those doing the punishing. By contrast, they were dealing with someone who had caused harm, with an irresponsible piece of fate. And even the man on whom punishment later fell, once again like a piece of fate, experienced in that no “inner pain,” other than what might have come from the sudden arrival of something unpredictable, a terrible natural event, a falling, crushing boulder against which there is no way to fight any more.
15
At one point Spinoza became aware of this issue in an incriminating way (something which irritates his interpreters, like Kuno Fischer, who really go to great lengths to misunderstand him on this matter), when one afternoon, he came up against some memory or other (who knows what?) and pondered the question about what, as far as he was concerned, was left of the celebrated morsus conscientiae —for him, the man who had expelled good and evil into human fantasies and had irascibly defended the honour of his “free” God against those blasphemers who claimed that in everything God worked sub ratione boni  (“but that means that God would be subordinate to Fate, a claim which, in truth, would be the greatest of all contradictions”). For Spinoza the world had gone back again into that state of innocence in which it had existed before the invention of bad conscience. So with that what, then, had become of the morsus conscientiae? “The opposite of gaudium ,” Spinoza finally told himself “is sorrow, accompanied by the image of something over and done with which happened contrary to all expectation” (Ethics III, Proposition XVIII, Schol. I. II). In a manner no different from Spinoza’s, those instigating evil who incurred punishment have for thousands of years felt, so far as their “crime” is concerned, “Something has unexpectedly gone awry here,” not “I should not have done that”—they submitted to their punishment as people submit to a sickness or some bad luck or death, with that brave fatalism free of revolt which, for example, even today gives the Russians an advantage over us westerners in coping with life. If back then there was some criticism of the act, such criticism came from prudence: without question we must seek the essential effect of punishment above all in an increase of prudence, in an extension of memory, in a will to go to work from now on more carefully, more mistrustfully, more secretly, with the awareness that we are in many things definitely too weak, in a kind of improved ability to judge ourselves. In general, what can be achieved through punishment, in human beings and animals, is an increase in fear, a honing of prudence, control over desires. In the process, punishment tames human beings, but it does not make them “better”—people could with more justification assert the opposite. (Popular wisdom says “Injury makes people prudent,” but to the extent that it makes them prudent, it also makes them bad. Fortunately, often enough it makes people stupid).
16
At this point, I can no longer avoid setting out, in an initial, provisional statement, my own hypothesis about the origin of “bad conscience.” It is not easy to get people to attend to it, and it requires them to consider it at length, to guard it, and to sleep on it. I consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings had to come down with under the pressure of that most fundamental of all the changes which they ever experienced—that change when they finally found themselves locked within the confines of society and peace. Just like the things water animals must have gone though when they were forced either to become land animals or to die off, so events must have played themselves out with this half-beast so happily adapted to the wilderness, war, wandering around, adventure—suddenly all its instincts were devalued and “disengaged.” From this point on, these animals were to go on foot and “carry themselves”; whereas previously they had been supported by the water. A terrible heaviness weighed them down. In performing the simplest things they felt ungainly. In dealing with this new unknown world, they no longer had their old leaders, the ruling unconscious drives which guided them safely—these unfortunate creatures were reduced to thinking, inferring, calculating, bringing together cause and effect, reduced to their “consciousness,” their most impoverished and error-prone organ! I believe that never on earth has there been such a feeling of misery, such a leaden discomfort—while at the same time those old instincts had not all of a sudden stopped imposing their demands! Only it was difficult and seldom possible to do their bidding. For the most part, they had to find new and, as it were, underground satisfactions for themselves. All instincts which are not discharged to the outside are turned back inside—this is what I call the internalization  of man. From this first grows in man what people later call his “soul.” The entire inner world, originally as thin as if stretched between two layers of skin, expanded and extended itself, acquired depth, width, and height, to the extent that what a person discharged out into the world was obstructed. Those frightening fortifications with which the organization of the state protected itself against the old instincts for freedom—punishments belong above all to these fortifications—brought it about that all those instincts of the wild, free, roaming man turned themselves backwards, against man himself. Enmity, cruelty, joy in pursuit, in attack, in change, in destruction—all those turned themselves against the possessors of such instincts. That is the origin of “bad conscience.” The man who, because of a lack of external enemies and opposition, was forced into an oppressive narrowness and regularity of custom impatiently tore himself apart, persecuted himself, gnawed away at himself, grew upset, and did himself damage—this animal which scraped itself raw against the bars of its cage, which people want to “tame,” this impoverished creature, consumed with longing for the wild, which had to create out of its own self an adventure, a torture chamber, an uncertain and dangerous wilderness—this fool, this yearning and puzzled prisoner, became the inventor of “bad conscience.” But with him was introduced the greatest and weirdest illness, from which humanity up to the present time has not recovered, the suffering of man from man, from himself, a consequence of the forcible separation from his animal past, a leap and, so to speak, a fall into new situations and living conditions, a declaration of war against the old instincts, on which, up to that point, his power, joy, and ability to inspire fear had been based. Let us at once add that, on the other hand, the fact that there was on earth an animal soul turned against itself, taking sides against itself, meant there was something so new, profound, unheard of, enigmatic, contradictory, and full of the future, that with it the picture of the earth was fundamentally changed. In fact, it required divine spectators to appreciate the dramatic performance which then began and whose conclusion is by no means yet in sight—a spectacle too fine, too wonderful, too paradoxical, to be allowed to play itself out senselessly and unobserved on some ridiculous star or other! Since then man has been included among the most unexpected and most thrillingly lucky rolls of the dice in the game played by Heraclitus’ “great child,” whether he’s called Zeus or chance.* For himself he arouses a certain interest, a tension, a hope, almost a certainty, as if something is announcing itself with him, something is preparing itself, as if the human being were not the goal but only a way, an episode, a bridge, a great promise . . .
17
Inherent in this hypothesis about the origin of bad conscience is, firstly, the assumption that the change was not gradual or voluntary and did not manifest itself as an organic growth into new conditions, but as a break, a leap, something forced, an irrefutable disaster, against which there was no struggle nor even any ressentiment. Secondly, however, it assumes that the adaptation of a populace hitherto unchecked and shapeless into a fixed form, just as it was initiated by an act of violence, was carried to its conclusion by nothing but acts of violence—that consequently the oldest “State” emerged as a terrible tyranny, as an oppressive and inconsiderate machinery, and continued working until such raw materials of people and half-animals finally were not only thoroughly kneaded and submissive but also given a shape. I used the word “State”: it is self-evident who is meant by that term—some pack of blond predatory animals, a race of conquerors and masters, which, organized for war and with the power to organize, without thinking about it, sets its terrifying paws on a subordinate population which may perhaps be vast in numbers but is still without any form, is still wandering about. That is, in fact, the way the “State” begins on earth. I believe that fantasy has been done away with which sees the beginning of the state in a “contract.” The man who can command, who is by nature a “master,” who comes forward with violence in his actions and gestures—what has he to do with making contracts! We do not negotiate with such beings. They come like fate, without cause, reason, consideration, or pretext. They are present as lightning is present, too fearsome, too sudden, too convincing, too “different” even to become merely hated. Their work is the instinctive creation of forms, the imposition of forms. They are the most involuntary and most unconscious artists in existence:—where they appear something new is soon present, a power structure which lives, something in which the parts and functions are demarcated and coordinated, in which there is, in general, no place for anything which does not first derive its “meaning” from its relationship to the totality. These men, these born organizers, have no idea what guilt, responsibility, and consideration are. In them that fearsome egotism of the artist is in charge, which stares out like bronze and knows how to justify itself for all time in the “work,” just as a mother does in her child. They are not the ones in whom “bad conscience” grew—that point is obvious from the outset. But this hateful plant would not have grown without them. It would have failed if an immense amount of freedom had not been driven from the world under the pressure of their hammer blows, their artistic violence, or at least had not been driven from sight and, as it were, made latent. This powerful instinct for freedom, once made latent—we already understand how—this instinct for freedom driven back, repressed, imprisoned inside, and finally still able to discharge and direct itself only against itself—that and that alone is what bad conscience is in its beginning.
18
We need to be careful not to entertain a low opinion of this entire phenomenon simply because it is from the start nasty and painful. In fact, it is basically the same active force which is at work on a grander scale in those artists of power and organizers and which builds states. Here it is inner, smaller, more mean spirited, directing itself backwards, into “the labyrinth of the breast,” to use Goethe’s words, and it creates bad conscience for itself and builds negative ideals, just that instinct for freedom (to use my own language, the will to power). Only the material on which the shaping and violating nature of this force directs itself here is simply man himself, his entire old animal self— and not, as in that greater and more striking phenomenon, on another man or on other men. This furtive violation of the self, this artistic cruelty, this pleasure in giving a shape to oneself as a tough, resisting, suffering material, to burn into it a will, a critique, a contradiction, a contempt, a denial, this weird and horribly pleasurable work of a soul willingly divided against itself, which makes itself suffer for the pleasure of creating suffering, all this active “bad conscience,” as the essential womb of ideal and imaginative events, finally brought to light —we have already guessed—also an abundance of strange new beauty and affirmation and perhaps for the first time the idea of the beautiful in general. . . . For what would be “beautiful,” if its opposite had not yet come to an awareness of itself, if ugliness had not already said to itself, “I am ugly”? At least, after this hint the paradox will be less puzzling, the extent to which in contradictory ideas, like selflessness, self-denial, self-sacrifice, an ideal can be indicated, something beautiful. And beyond that, one thing we do know—I have no doubt about it—namely, the nature of the pleasure which the selfless, self-denying, self-sacrificing person experiences from the beginning: this pleasure belongs to cruelty. So much for the moment on the origin of the “un-egoistic” as something of moral worth and on the demarcation of the soil out of which this value has grown: only bad conscience, only the will to abuse the self, provides the condition for the value of the un-egoistic.
19
Bad conscience is a sickness—there’s no doubt about that—but a sickness the way pregnancy is a sickness. Let’s look for the conditions in which this illness has arrived at its most terrible and most sublime peak:—in this way we’ll see what really brought about its entry into the world at the start. But that requires a lot of endurance—and we must first go back once more to an earlier point of view. The relationship in civil law between the debtor and his creditor, which I have reviewed extensively already, has been interpreted once again in an extremely remarkable and dubious historical manner into a relationship which we modern men are perhaps least capable of understanding, namely, into the relationship between those people presently alive and their ancestors. Within the original tribal cooperatives—we’re talking about primeval times—the living generation always acknowledged a legal obligation to the previous generations, and especially to the earliest one which had founded the tribe (and this was in no way merely a sentimental obligation: the latter is something we could even reasonably claim was, in general, absent for the longest period of the human race). Here the reigning conviction is that the tribe exists at all only because of the sacrifices and achievements of its ancestors—and that people have to pay them back with sacrifices and achievements.  In this people recognize a debt which keeps steadily growing because these ancestors in their continuing existence as powerful spirits do not stop giving the tribe new advantages and lending them their power. Do they do this gratuitously? But there is no “gratuitously” for those raw and “spiritually destitute” ages. What can people give back to them? Sacrifices (at first as nourishment understood very crudely), festivals, chapels, signs of honour, above all, obedience—for all customs, as work of one’s ancestors, are also their statutes and commands. Do people ever give them enough? This suspicion remains and grows. From time to time it forcefully requires a huge wholesale redemption, something immense as a repayment  to the “creditor” (the notorious sacrifice of the first born, for example, blood, human blood in any case). The fear of ancestors and their power, the awareness of one’s debt to them, according to this kind of logic, necessarily increases directly in proportion to the increase in the power of the tribe itself, as the tribe finds itself constantly more victorious, more independent, more honoured, and more feared. It’s not the other way around! Every step towards the decline of the tribe, all conditions of misery, all indications of degeneration, of approaching dissolution, rather lead to a constant lessening of the fear of the spirit of its founder and give a constantly smaller image of his wisdom, providence, and powerful presence. If we think this crude form of logic through to its conclusion, then the ancestors of the most powerful tribes must, because of the fantasy of increasing fear, finally have grown into something immense and have been pushed back into the darkness of a divine mystery, something beyond the powers of imagination, so that finally the ancestor is necessarily transfigured into a god. Here perhaps lies even the origin of the gods, thus an origin out of fear! . . . And the man to whom it seems obligatory to add “But also out of piety” could hardly claim to be right for the longest period of the human race, for his primaeval age. Of course, he would be all the more correct for the middle period, in which the noble tribes developed—those who in fact paid back to their founders, their ancestors (heroes, gods), with interest, all the characteristics which in the meantime had become manifest in themselves, the noble qualities. Later we will have another look at the process by which the gods were ennobled and exalted (which is naturally not at all the same thing as their becoming “holy”). But now, for the moment, let’s follow the path of this whole development of the consciousness of guilt to its conclusion.
20
As history teaches us, the consciousness of being in debt to the gods did not in any way come to an end after the downfall of the organization of the “community” based on blood relationships. Just as humanity inherited the ideas of “good and bad” from the nobility of the tribe (together with its fundamental psychological tendency to set up orders of rank), in the same way people also inherited, as well as the divinities of the tribe and of the extended family, the pressure of as yet unpaid debts and the desire to be relieved of them. (The transition is made with those numerous slave and indentured populations which adapted themselves to the divine cults of their masters, whether through compulsion or through obsequiousness and mimicry; from them this inheritance then overflowed in all directions). The feeling of being indebted to the gods did not stop growing for several thousands of years, always, in fact, in direct proportion to the extent to which the idea of god and the feeling for god grew on earth and were carried to the heights. (The entire history of ethnic fighting, victory, reconciliation, mergers, everything which comes before the final rank ordering of all the elements of a people in every great racial synthesis, is mirrored in the tangled genealogies of its gods, in the sagas of their fights, victories, and reconciliations. The progress towards universal empires is always also the progress toward universal divinities. In addition, despotism, with its overthrow of the independent nobility always builds the way to some variety of monotheism). The arrival of the Christian god, as the greatest  god which has yet been reached, thus brought about the maximum feeling of indebtedness on earth. Assuming that we have gradually set out in the reverse direction, we can infer with no small probability that, given the inexorable decline of faith in the Christian god, even now there may already be a considerable decline in the human consciousness of guilt. Indeed, we cannot dismiss the idea that the complete and final victory of atheism could release humanity from this entire feeling of being indebted to its origin, its causa prima . Atheism and a kind of second innocence belong together.—
21
So much for a brief and rough preface concerning the connection between the ideas “guilt” and “obligation” with religious assumptions. Up to this point I have deliberately set aside the actual moralizing of these ideas (the repression of them into the conscience, or more precisely, the complex interaction of the bad conscience with the idea of god). At the end of the previous section I even talked as if there were no such thing as this moralizing and thus as if those ideas were now necessarily coming to an end after the collapse of their presuppositions, the faith in our “creditor,” in God. But to a terrifying extent the facts indicate something different. The moralizing of the ideas of debt and duty, with their repression into the bad conscience, actually gave rise to the attempt to reverse the direction of the development I have just described, or at least to bring its motion to a halt. Now, in a fit of pessimism, the prospect of a final installment must once and for all be denied; now, our gaze must bounce and ricochet back despairingly off an iron impossibility, now those ideas of “debt” and “duty” must  turn back. But against whom? There can be no doubt: first of all against the “debtor,” in whom from this point on bad conscience sets itself firmly, gnaws away, spreads out, and, like a polyp, grows wide and deep to such an extent that finally, with the impossibility of discharging the debt, people also come up with the notion that it is impossible to remove the penance, the idea that it cannot be paid off (“eternal punishment”):—finally however, those ideas of “debt” and “duty” turn back even against the “creditor.” People should, in this matter, now think about the causa prima  of humanity, about the beginning of the human race, about their ancestor who from now on is loaded down with a curse (“Adam,” “original sin,” “no freedom of the will”) or about nature from whose womb human beings arose and into which the principle of evil is now inserted (“the demonizing of nature”) or about existence in general, which remains something inherently without value  (nihilistic turning away from existence, longing for nothingness, or a desire for its “opposite,” in an alternate state of being, Buddhism and things like that)—until all of a sudden we confront the paradoxical and horrifying expedient with which a martyred humanity found temporary relief, that stroke of genius of Christianity: God sacrificing himself for the guilt of human beings, God paying himself back with himself, God as the only one who can redeem man from what for human beings has become impossible to redeem—the creditor sacrificing himself for the debtor, out of love (can people believe that?), out of love for his debtor! . . .
22
You will already have guessed what really went on with all this and under all this: that will to self-torment, that repressed cruelty of animal man pushed inward and forced back into himself, imprisoned in the “state” to make him tame, who invented bad conscience in order to lacerate himself, after the more natural discharge of this will to inflict pain had been blocked—this man of bad conscience seized upon religious assumptions to drive his self-torment to its most horrifying hardship and ferocity. Guilt towards God: this idea becomes his instrument of torture. In “God” he seizes on the ultimate contrast he is capable of discovering to his real and indissoluble animal instincts. He interprets these animal instincts themselves as a crime against God (as enmity, rebellion, revolt against the “master,” the “father,” the original ancestor and beginning of the world). He grows tense with the contradiction of “God” and “devil.” He hurls from himself every “No” which he says to himself, to nature, naturalness, the factual reality  of his being as a “Yes,” as something existing, as living, as real, as God, as the blessedness of God, as God the Judge, as God the Hangman, as something beyond him, as eternity, as perpetual torment, as hell, as punishment and guilt beyond measure. In this spiritual cruelty there is a kind of insanity of the will which simply has no equal: a man’s will finding him so guilty and reprehensible that there is no atonement, his will to imagine himself punished, but in such a way that the punishment could never be adequate for his crime, his will to infect and poison the most fundamental basis of things with the problem of punishment and guilt in order to cut himself off once and for all from any exit out of this labyrinth of “fixed ideas,” his will to erect an ideal—that of the “holy God”—in order to be tangibly certain of his own absolute worthlessness when confronted with it. O this insane, sad beast man! What ideas it has, what unnaturalness, what paroxysms of nonsense, what bestiality of thought breaks from it as soon as it is prevented, if only a little, from being a beast in deed! . . . All this is excessively interesting, but there’s also a black, gloomy, unnerving sadness about it, so that man must forcefully hold himself back from gazing too long into these abysses. Here we have illness  — no doubt about that—the most terrifying illness that has raged in human beings up to now:—and anyone who can still hear (but nowadays people no longer have the ear for that!—) how in this night of torment and insanity the cry of love has resounded, the cry of the most yearning delight, of redemption through love, turns away, seized by an invincible horror. . . In human beings there is so much that is terrible! . . . The world has already been a lunatic asylum for too long!
23
These remarks should be sufficient, once and for all, concerning the origin of the “holy God.”—The fact that conceiving gods does not necessarily, in itself, have to lead to this degraded imagination, that’s something we could not excuse ourselves from recalling for a moment, the point that there are more uplifting ways to use the invention of the gods than for this human self-crucifixion and self-laceration, in which Europe in the last millennia has become an expert—fortunately that’s something we can still infer with every glance we cast at the Greek gods, these reflections of nobler men, more rulers of themselves, in whom the animal in man felt himself deified and did not tear himself apart, did not rage against himself! These Greeks for the longest time used their gods for the very purpose of keeping that “bad conscience” at a distance, in order to be permitted to continue enjoying their psychic freedom. Hence, their understanding was the opposite of how Christianity used its God. In this matter the Greeks went a very long way, these splendid and lion-hearted Greeks, with their child-like minds. And no lesser authority than that of Homer’s Zeus himself now and then lets them understand that they are making things too easy for themselves. “It’s strange,” he says at one point in relation to the case of Aegisthus, a very bad case—
It’s strange how these mortal creatures complain about the gods!
Evil comes only from us, they claim, but they themselves
Stupidly make themselves miserable, even contrary to fate.*
But at the same time we hear and see that even this Olympian spectator and judge is far from being irritated and from thinking them evil because of this: “How foolish they are,” he thinks in relation to the bad deeds of mortal men—and even the Greeks of the strongest and bravest times conceded that much about themselves—the “foolishness,” “stupidity,” a little “disturbance in the head” were the basis for many bad and fateful things—foolishness, not sin! Do you understand that? . . . But even this disturbance in the head was a problem, “Indeed, how is this even possible? Where could this have really come from in heads like the ones we have, we men of noble descent, happy, successful, from the best society, noble, and virtuous?”—for hundreds of years the aristocratic Greek posed this question to himself in relation to every horror or outrage incomprehensible to him which had defiled one of his peers. “Some god must have deluded him,” he finally said, shaking his head . . . This solution is typical of the Greeks . . . In this way, the gods then served to justify men to a certain extent, even in bad things. They served as the origins of evil—at that time the gods took upon themselves, not punishment, but, what is nobler, the guilt. . .
24
—I’ll conclude with three question marks—that’s clear enough. You may perhaps ask me, “Is an ideal actually being built up here or shattered?” . . . But have you ever really asked yourself enough how high a price has been paid on earth for the construction of every ideal? How much reality had to be constantly vilified and misunderstood for that to happen, how many lies had to be consecrated, how many consciences corrupted, how much “god” had to be sacrificed every time? In order to enable a shrine to be built, a shrine must be destroyed: that is the law—show me the case where it has not been fulfilled! We modern men, we are the inheritors of thousands of years of vivisection of the conscience and self-inflicted animal torture. That’s what we have had the longest practice doing, that is perhaps our artistry; in any case, it’s something we have refined, the corruption of our taste. For too long man has looked at his natural inclinations with an “evil eye,” so that finally in him they have become twinned with “bad conscience.” An attempt to reverse this might, in itself, be possible—but who is strong enough for it, that is, to link as siblings bad conscience and the unnatural inclinations, all those aspirations for what lies beyond, those things which go against our senses, against our instincts, against nature, against animals—in short, the earlier ideals, all the ideals which are hostile to life, ideals of those who vilify the world? To whom can we turn to today with such hopes and demands? . . .  In this we would have precisely the good people against us, as well, of course, as the comfortable, the complacent, the vain, the enthusiastic, the tired. . . .  But what is more deeply offensive, what cuts us off so fundamentally, as letting them take some note of the severity and loftiness with which  we deal with ourselves? And, by contrast, how obliging, how friendly all the world is in relation to us, as soon as we act as all the world does and “let ourselves go” just like all the world! To attain the goal I’m talking about requires a different sort of spirit from those which are likely to exist at this particular time: spirits empowered by war and victory, for whom conquest, adventure, danger, and even pain have become a need. That would require getting acclimatized to keen, high air, winter wanderings, to ice and mountains in every sense. That would require even a kind of sublime maliciousness, an ultimate self-conscious wilfulness of knowledge, which comes with great health. Simply and seriously put, that would require just this great health! . . . Is this even possible today? . . . But at some time or other, in a more powerful time than this mouldy, self-doubting present, he must nonetheless come to us, the redeeming man of great love and contempt, the creative spirit, constantly pushed again and again away from every sideline or from the beyond by his own driving power, whose isolation is misunderstood by people as if it were a flight from reality—whereas it is only his immersion, burial, and absorption in reality, so that once he comes out of it into the light again, he brings home the redemption of this reality, its redemption from the curse which the previous ideal has laid upon it. This man of the future, who will release us from that earlier ideal just as much as from what had to grow from it, from the great loathing, from the will to nothingness, from nihilism—that stroke of noon and of the great decision which makes the will free once again, who gives back to the earth its purpose and to the human being his hope, this anti-Christ and anti-nihilist, this conqueror of God and of nothingness—at some point he must come . . .
25
But what am I talking about here? Enough, enough! At this stage there’s only one thing appropriate for me to do: keep quiet. Otherwise, I’ll make the mistake of arrogating to myself something which only someone younger is free to do, someone “more of the future,” someone more powerful than I am—something which only Zarathustra is free to do, Zarathustra the Godless . . . .*

Pope Innocent III: (1161-1216), an important and powerful medieval Pope. 
. . . ressentiment: As mentioned above (in the First Essay), Nietzsche uses this French word, which since his writing, and largely because of it, has entered the English language as an important term in psychology: a short definition is as follows: “deep-seated resentment, frustration, and hostility, accompanied by a sense of being powerless to express these feelings directly” (Merriam-Webster). Ressentiment is thus significantly different in meaning from resentment.

Zeus makes these remarks to the other Olympian gods at the start of Homer’s Odyssey. Aegisthus seduced Clytaemnestra, and the two of them murdered Agamemnon, her husband, as soon as he returned home from the Trojan War. The gods, according to Homer, had warned him against these actions. 
Zarathustra: a name for the Persian prophet Zoroaster, which Nietzsche appropriates to designate a spokesman for his own ideas. "Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!"

But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

"Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"."

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier


Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true


Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you
 until fade

Chatroom 1
WTME
The best music on your FM dial
Yeah, caller you're on the air
"Hello, is this WTME?"
Yes it is
"Well my name is Shaquanda Jenkins" (Mmm) uh huh
"And I'm from Brooklyn, Am I still on the radio?"
Yes "Cause I got maaad stuff to say about them" uh huh?
"Oh my god that b**** ****** Blaque?" (Woah what?!)
Easy with the language "These b****** are the worst" Easy!
(Come on now, I know) "I heard the song, their song is mad whack"
(Thank you:/s) "I don't even know why you playin' it on the radio"
(Alright? Nah) "That will not be in the top 10 list at all, ya need to cut it out the system."(Who? What?) "Is there anybody out there listenin' to them? Cause I don't think so" (Uh uh turn her off, cut her off cut her off, We don't need that kind of energy)

I think we're gonna move on (What?)
We're gonna move onto the next caller (In unison: Thank You!)
We're gonna move on (The biggest fan, whatever)
Yeah we don't need that kind of energy on WTME (No, we don't)
We're gonna move onCUDDY: Dr. Riley is throwing up; he obviously can’t lecture
HOUSE: You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it? I think I’m coming down with a little bit of the clap. I may have to go home for a few days.
CUDDY:  Dr. Riley doesn’t have a history of lying to me.
HOUSE: You said this is the fifth time he’s missed a class this year! Either he’s dying or he’s lying.
CUDDY: I’ll give you two hours off clinic duty.
HOUSE: Fine, I’ll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. *He starts to walk off*
CUDDY: You’ll do it.
HOUSE:  Why is it always me?
CUDDY: Because the world hates you. Or because it’s a class on diagnostics. Pick whatever reason feeds your narcissism better.
HOUSE: I’m not doing it.  You’re supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.
CUDDY: Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.
HOUSE: I’ll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.
CUDDY: Two. I know you’d rather spend a couple of hours listening to yourself than listening to patients. Class starts in twenty minutes. 
BRENDA: Dr. House, there’s a patient.
HOUSE: I’m outta here, take it up with Cuddy.
A voice: Gregg. 
HOUSE: Hi, Stacy.
STACY: How’re you doing?
HOUSE: How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like… you ever see those “Girls Gone Wild” videos?
STACY: Your life’s been like that, or your life’s been spent watching them?  I have missed you.
HOUSE: Is that why you’re here? 
STACY: I need your help. 
HOUSE: Who am I looking at?
STACY: My husband.
HOUSE: Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells. No sign of tumors, no vasculitis. Could be indigestion, or maybe a kidney stone. A little one, can pack a lot of wallop.
STACY: Did you think I wasn’t going to get married?
HOUSE: Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy’s pancreas is pathetic. 
STACY: There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.
HOUSE: Well, maybe there’s nothing to be found.
STACY: Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.
HOUSE: The walks are out. 
STACY: I was around you long enough to know when something’s not right. Mark’s had personality changes, he’s acting strange, disconnected…
HOUSE: Interesting. It means there’s either a neurological component or he’s having an affair.
STACY: No affair, no nothing! He’s sick! I know you’re not too busy; you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I’m asking you a favor.
HOUSE: I’m not too busy, but I’m not sure I want him to live. It’s good seeing you again. 


HOUSE: Three guys walk into a clinic. Their legs hurt. What’s wrong with them?  I’m not going to like you, am I?
KEEN: Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.
HOUSE: Statistically, you’re right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That’s six legs. So, you’ve got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant. 
CARING: What were they doing when pain presented?
HOUSE: I have no idea. 
REBELLIOUS: You didn’t ask? You didn’t take a history?
HOUSE: Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened. Person A, farmer, says he was fixing a fence.  Tightness of the ankle, loss of muscle control.  Person B, volleyball practice.  Coach figured it was a pulled muscle. And C,  we’ve got Carmen Electra. Golfing. 
KEEN: Whoa, you treated the Baywatch chick?
House: The Baywatch thespian. And no, I’ve gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she’s apparently quite the golfer.  Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which?  Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

HOUSE: Did you hike to the fence, and how far?
FARMER: Yes, it’s about half a mile from my farmhouse.
HOUSE: And where’s the pain localized?
FARMER: It started just above my ankle and it’s radiating up.
House: So, what should we do first? 
KEEN: Family history?
House: Indicative of leg pain? That’s a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? 
CARING: Could be a blood issue. We should run a CBC and a D-dimer. 
REBELLIOUS: And get an MRI.
CARING: MRI or a PET scan?
REBELLIOUS: If the problem’s vascular, he’s better off –
HOUSE: Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient’s dead. You killed him. 
KEEN: We had no time to run any tests; there was nothing we could do!
HOUSE: You had time to look at the leg. 

CARING: I thought we were starting with the farmer’s case first.
HOUSE: We are. But if we’re going to look at a leg…

HOUSE: I need you to take off your pants.  Puncture.

CARING: Snakebite.
HOUSE: That would be my guess.
REBELLIOUS: Farmer didn’t know he had been bit by a snake?
HOUSE: That’s what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, never saw a thing.
KEEN: What kind of snake?
HOUSE: You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?
KEEN: How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don’t know what kind of snake it is?
HOUSE: Oh, there are people to find those things out.

CHASE: Shouldn’t we wait for the Humane Society or something?
Foreman: The guy might only have a couple of hours. 

HOUSE: And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?

CAMERON: You have tendonitis.

CARING: How old is this person? I mean, it’s not really a 40-year-old man on a girls’ volleyball team, right?
HOUSE: It’s a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.
CARING: Well, I was just worried that –
HOUSE: Would you worry about her more if she was younger?
KEEN: Obviously we should care about our patients no matter what age –
HOUSE: Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She’s mine, stay away.  Would you operate on your mother?
CARING: Of course not. I’d be too nervous; couldn’t be objective.
HOUSE: Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they’re family? The actual patient is 16. Here’s what happens when doctors care to much.

CAMERON: I need to know everything about you. 

CAMERON: I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson’s, or any other degenerative condition. But there’s this boy at school, and he’s on the boys’ volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won’t call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn’t like her and never did.
HOUSE: You got all this from an examination of the knee?
CAMERON: I think she’s depressed.
HOUSE: She doesn’t have tendoni—
CAMERON: She has tendonitis.
HOUSE: She’s depressed about having tendonitis.
CAMERON: She’s depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.
HOUSE: Not the boy.
CAMERON: No, the boy’s a jerk, she knows that, and yet she’s depressed. I found a nodule.
HOUSE: Ah. Problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.
CAMERON:  I’ll run the tests.

CARING: So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.
HOUSE: No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.


HOUSE: Here’s how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.

CARMEN: Can I put my pants back on now?
HOUSE: I’d rather you didn’t. 
CARING: Which Carmen Electra is this?
HOUSE: First one. The golfer. 
KEEN: Then why isn’t she wearing pants? 
HOUSE:  You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? 
REBELLIOUS: Slipped disc?
HOUSE: Could be. How bad does it hurt?
CARMEN:  It hurts really, really bad.
HOUSE: Yeah?
CARING: It doesn’t seem real. Is she the one faking?
HOUSE: Oh, for God’s sake. She’s here to play out my fantasy, not because she’s Meryl Streep.  Fine. 
LATE 30s MAN: What the hell is wrong with me?  Do something! 
CARING: Too much pain to be a slipped disc. Could be herniated and impinging the nerve root. 
KEEN: Or it could be referred pain from his groin.
HOUSE: Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? 
KEEN: He’s curling; it’s not the back.
HOUSE: Sir, where are you getting pain?
LATE 30s MAN: Help me!
HOUSE: Oooh.
REBELLIOUS: He’s not going to tell us anything if we don’t get him out of pain. Give him 50mg of Demerol.
CARING: We have no history, he could be allergic.
HOUSE:  What do I do?
REBELLIOUS: We can’t diagnose him while he screams.
CARING: Better than killing him with pain killers, then – 
HOUSE: Apparently, he’s not allergic.
LATE 30s MAN: Thank you, I feel a lot better now. 

CARING: We screwed up.
HOUSE: No, you did exactly what his attending did.
REBELLIOUS: And that was the proper way to handle the case?
HOUSE: Yeah.
REBELLIOUS: The guy used him as a dealer!
HOUSE: You’re going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there’s a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm…

CHASE:  Yeah, timber rattlesnake.

CAMERON: Four vials of the CroFab antivenin. Hey, how you doing?
FARMER: All right.
CAMERON:  Thank you. This will start making you feel better really fast.  He’s having an allergic reaction, bag.  Paddles and epi.
NURSE: But his heart’s fine—
CAMERON: It’s not going to stay that way.  Paddles!

HOUSE: What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. 

WILSON: You didn’t think she was going to get married?
HOUSE: She asked me the same question.
WILSON: And… what? You’re not gonna treat him?
HOUSE: There’s probably nothing wrong with him.
Wilson: Oh, sure, that makes sense. She’s just using the old “sick husband” routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she’d be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.
HOUSE: So I should help her because she hates me.
WILSON: She doesn’t hate you. She loves you, she just can’t stand to be around you. 
KEEN: Uh, Dr. House? It’s been almost six minutes.

KEEN: Found him.
HOUSE: The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you’d expect in a case of tendonitis.
REBELLIOUS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don’t really care about the volleyball player.
HOUSE: What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?
REBELLIOUS: Really?
HOUSE: No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It’s not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.
REBELLIOUS: You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.
HOUSE: No, I didn’t. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.

CAMERON: We’re going to start you on Thyroxin. It’ll make you feel better and level your moods.
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Thank you. 

REBELLIOUS: So, that’s it?
HOUSE: You were right the first time. Snakebite guy’s way more interesting. Gross, actually.


FOREMAN: The patient responded to epinephrine and the allergic reaction was arrested. Unfortunately, the patient continues to deteriorate.
CHASE: Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type he caught.
FOREMAN: He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it’s a timber rattlesnake.
HOUSE:  No, it’s not. Notice the volume?
FOREMAN: I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.
HOUSE: 200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There’s no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.

KEEN: We’re supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?
HOUSE: Nope. Unless you’ve got a patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?
CARING: He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.
HOUSE: Or you go online and find there’s only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.
CARING: So we give him the antivenin for the other one.
HOUSE: Is that a question?
KEEN: Well, we can’t just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?
HOUSE: Very good.
KEEN: We’ve gotta find the right snake.
HOUSE: No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.
KEEN: But you said –
CARING: So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.
HOUSE: Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin?  And who goes looking for the snake?
REBELLIOUS: I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.
HOUSe: That’s usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.
CARING: So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.
HOUSE: Yeah.
KEEN: But we can’t be blamed for –
HOUSE: I’m sure this goes against everything you’ve been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don’t know what the right answer is – maybe there’s even no way you could know what the right answer is – doesn’t make your answer right or even okay. It’s much simpler than that. It’s just plain wrong.

HOUSE:  We gave the guy the antivenin.
FARMER: What if I’m allergic again?
FOREMAN: That’s why these people are here. If you have a reaction, we’re ready to do whatever’s necessary to ensure your airway stays open and your heart keeps beating.
FARMER: My wife’s on her way in, can’t this wait?
FOREMAN: I’m sorry, it can’t. [He begins to inject the serum, and nothing happens. House nods, and leaves the room to be confronted by the Late 30s Man.
LATE 30s MAN: It hurts again.

CARING: He came back?
HOUSE:  On average, drug addicts are stupid.
REBELLIOUS: I’d call the cops.
HOUSE: Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn’t risk their careers on a hunch.
REBELLIOUS: It’s not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.
HOUSE: I believe drug addicts get sick. Actually, for some reason they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts. Luckily, you don’t have to play your hunch, there’s a faster way. Actually, there are several. My preference is urine testing.
REBELLIOUS: But you already know he has drugs in his system.
HOUSE: That’s not what I’m testing for.

HOUSE: We’re going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable.
LATE 30s MAN: Shouldn’t I be getting some kind of anesthetic? 
HOUSE: We’re concerned about allergic reactions today.

HOUSE: If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he’s really sick.
REBELLIOUS: Or he’s really jonesing.
HOUSE: There’s easier ways to get a hold of drugs. Other hospitals, for example.  The volleyball player is not responding to treatment.  At least we think it’s not working on account of the fact she’s getting worse. Can you still hear me?
REBELLIOUS: No.
CARING: A little.
KEEN: Not really!
HOUSE:  Well, if you can’t hear me, how do you know what I asked?

CAMERON: I’m sorry. What did I do?
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: I don’t know. It really hurts!
CAMERON: I promise to be very careful.  Susan!

HOUSE: Not her real name!

CAMERON: Susan, I barely touched you! 
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Aaaah! No, it hurts so much!
CAMERON: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I have to get this blood. Just hold on.

CAMERON: Hypersensitivity to touch.
CHASE: Her calcium up?
CAMERON: Lab over 16.
HOUSE: The question is why. Likely suspects?
CHASE: Parathyroid adenoma.
CAMERON: Kidney problems.
FOREMAN: Vit. D intoxification.
CHASE: Hyperthyroid.
FOREMAN: Caused by our treatment?

CARING: Whoa whoa whoa. Can you please slow down? 
HOUSE:  The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH –

HOUSE: -- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that’s enough about the volleyball player. What’s up with the farmer? 
FOREMAN: What farmer?
HOUSE: Snakebite guy. Oh, right, you guys don’t know about him. He doesn’t get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player. Luckily, it’s been well established that time is not a fixed construct.  His condition’s not improving; double the dosage.
FOREMAN: Already did.
HOUSE: There’s another antivenin, it’s not as effective, but –
CHASE: Already tried it.
HOUSE: The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to –
CAMERON: Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing’s working.
HOUSE:  What does it all mean?

CARING: Wrong snake?
HOUSE: We tried every other antivenin we had.
CARING: We’re too late?
HOUSE: Yep. He’s dying. His wife’s here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I’m kidding.
CARING: He’s not dying?
HOUSE: Oh, yeah, he’s dying, but there’s no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the “breaking the news” thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.


HOUSE: The drug addict is peeing blood.

HOUSE: How do they teach you how to tell someone that they’re dying? It’s kind of like teaching architects how to explain why their building fell down. Do you roleplay and stuff?
KEEN: Yeah, one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news.
HOUSE: And what do you have to do to get an A in You’re Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks every time somebody says “Thank you.” Imagine that. This guy’s so good, people thank him for telling them that they’re dying.  Eh, needs brown. I don’t get thanked that often.

HOUSE: You’re dying. In a few hours. There’s nothing we can do except deal with the pain.
FARMER: Well, I need to go home.
HOUSE: You’re not going home.
FARMER: Well, my dog? What will happen to my dog?

CAMERON: Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

REBELLIOUS: Wait, wait, wait. The guy’s dying and all he cares about is his dog?
HOUSE: Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It’s a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they’re dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they’re willing to die for. What they’re willing to lie for.

HOUSE: Well, you must have a neighbor who –
FARMER: The neighbors don’t like him.
HOUSE: Then the Humane Society can take him in and –
FARMER: No, they won’t. Maybe my aunt –
HOUSE: It wasn’t a snakebite, was it?
FARMER: I said I don’t remember being bit.
HOUSE: Sure you do. Just not by a snake. I assume that Cujo bit one of your neighbors awhile back. You tell me that he bit you, and I gotta report it. Cujo’s got a record, he gets the chair. The good news is, you might just live. The bad news is, your dog’s gonna die.

CHASe: The guy risked his life to save this thing?
FOREMAN: I’ll hold him, you swab the mouth.
CHASE: I think I’ve got a better grip here, you go for the mouth.  All right, I’m odds.
FOREMAN: What, are you serious?
CHASE: Come on.
FOREMAN: One, two, three! 
CHASE: I don’t care if he’s scratching your nads off, don’t let go.
FOREMAN: Just do it! 
CHASE: I say we let the guy die.
FOREMAN: I got his head, just do it!

HOUSE: What would you call that? That’s tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs… what’s the differential diagnosis for urine that’s tea-colored?
CARING: Kidney stone.
HOUSE: Kidney stones would cause what?
CARING: Blood in urine.
HOUSE: What color is your pee?
CARING: Yellow.
HOUSE: What color is your blood?
CARING: Red.
HOUSE: What colors did I use?
CARING: Red, yellow and brown.
HOUSE: And brown. What causes brown?
CARING: Wastes.
HOUSE: Which means the kidneys are shutting down. Why?
CARING: Trauma.
HOUSe: None that his history would indicate.
CARING: Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.
HOUSE: Treatment?
CARING: Heat and rest –
HOUSE: Other possible causes.
CARING: Infection.
HOUSE: Start him on antibiotics. What else?  Come on, come on!
CARING: I – I don’t know.
HOUSE: You’re useless. But at least you know it. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?
REBELLIOUS: The trauma diagnosis is right. He takes it easy for a few days, he’ll be fine.
HOUSE: You sure?
REBELLIOUS: The elevated CK rules out infection –
HOUSE: You know what’s worse than useless? Useless and oblivious.  What are they missing?
KEEN: You know, it’s kind of hard to think when you’re in our face like this –
HOUSE: Yeah? You think it’s going to be easier when you’ve got a real patient really dying?  What are you missing?]
CAMERON:  Muscle death.
HOUSE: Not your case.
CAMERON: Nothing wrong with a consult.
CARING: Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It’s toxic to the kidneys.
HOUSE: Brilliant. MRI his leg, see what’s killing it.


REBELLIOUS: Why is the girl getting the MRI?
HOUSE: Because the neck scan revealed nothing and her doctor’s way more obsessive than she thinks she is. 
REBELLIOUS: But you said the guy needed the MRI.
HOUSE: Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death, not one of you said it! Not one of this guy’s doctors said it. They gave him bed rest and antibiotics, just like you guys would have.
CARING: Did he get better?
HOUSE: No.
CARING: Well, how long –
HOUSE: Three days. It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up. You are gonna kill someone. If you can’t handle that reality, pick another profession. Or finish medical school and teach.
CARING: Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?
HOUSE: No, three days before the patient suggested it might have been muscle death.

CAMERON: The MRI revealed an osteosarcoma: a cancerous tumor in your femur. It needs to be removed surgically. With chemo, she has an excellent chance of survival. But I have to warn you, depending on how large the tumor is, and how ingrained it is, the surgeon may need to amputate your leg. I’m sorry.
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER'S MOTHER: It’s okay.

FOREMAN: Well, dogs’ mouths are pretty filthy, but they have natural antibodies to fight off most of the stuff. We don’t. That’s why dog bites can be so nasty. The lab test of your dog’s saliva revealed a type of strep bacteria. It’s commonly known as the “flesh eating disease”. We’ll need to operate immediately to remove the damaged tissue. We may need to remove the leg.

CUDDY: The MRI revealed a problem.
LATE 30s MAN: No kidding.
CUDDY: I’m sorry none of your doctors found it earlier; I’m personally going to oversee your treatment from now on.
LATE 30s MAN: You’re gonna cut me open, aren’t ya?
CUDDY: We may need to remove the leg.

HOUSE: His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn’t caused by the self-injection, wasn’t caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction.
FOREMAN:  God, you were right. It’s House.

CUDDY: We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there’s too much –
HOUSE: I don’t care what you find.
CUDDY: It may become necessary in order to save your life.
HOUSE: I like my leg. I’ve had it for as long as I can remember.
STACY: Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.
HOUSE: They’re not cutting it off.

HOUSE: Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it’s okay to cut a leg off and he’s going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.
REBELLIOUS: Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.
HOUSE: Well, of course they care about their patients. They just care about themselves more. Which is not an unreasonable position. Trying to maximize the tissue you save also maximizes the chances of something going wrong. Which means you’ve gotta be extra careful. Which is such a pain in the ass.

CUDDY: Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.
HOUSE: Yeah, they’re just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation.
CUDDY: Amputation is safer.
HOUSE: For you, or me?
CUDDY: The blockage of blood flow –
HOUSE: Four-day blockage.
CUDDY: Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --
HOUSE: If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system. The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest. On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.
CUDDY: The post-operative pain alone –
HOUSE: I’ll get through it. I understand the risks, you’re in the clear. Go schedule an OR. 
STACY: God, you’re an idiot.
HOUSe: I think I’m more of a jerk.
STACY: I’m not being glib. And I’m not being cute, I don’t want you to kill yourself.
HOUSE: I’m not gonna die.
STACY: Oh, I feel completely reassured.






HOUSE: I think they gotta up that morphine.
STACY: The doctors say they can’t.
HOUSE: The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.
STACY: They screwed up, it doesn’t mean they’re wrong this time.
HOUSE: Sure doesn’t mean they’re right.
STACY: Morphine will kill you.
HOUSE: I can handle it.
STACY: You’re in pain, you’re not thinking right.
HOUSE: That’s why I need the damn morphine!
STACY: Okay, I’ll talk to them. 

STACY: Oh my God, how much longer is the pain going to last?
CUDDY: It depends on how much muscle cell death there was. He could be right, he could come out of this with almost full use of his leg.
STACY: Or?
CUDDY: He could be in pain for the rest of his life. There’s a third option, surgically. A middle ground between what we did and amputation.
STACY: He’s not big on middle ground.
CUDDY: Yeah.

HOUSE: Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.
NURSE: You just had 5 mLs.
HOUSE: The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.
NURSE: I’ll talk to your doctor.
HOUSE: Well, you better make it fast, ‘cause I’m about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.
NURSE: I could get in trouble –
HOUSE: Listen, it’s not a narcotic! I’m not looking for a buzz. You’ve got about twenty seconds.  I was wrong. 
SOMEONE: What have you got?
NURSE: Wide complex tachycardia.
CUDDY: Who diagnosed –
NURSE: He did.
CUDDY: Paddles! Charge.
NURSE: Clear! 

HOUSE: The patient was technically dead for over a minute.



CUDDY: He’s back.

WILSON:  Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?
HOUSE: Define real. They were real experiences. What they meant… Personally, I choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see visions, this patient saw. They’re all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down.
FOREMAN: You choose to believe that?
HOUSE: There’s no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.
CAMERON: You find it more comforting to believe that this is it?
HOUSE: I find it more comforting to believe that this isn’t simply a test.

STACY: How bad is the pain right now?
HOUSE: It’s bad.
STACY: It’s not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You’d be getting better.
HOUSE: It’s just taking longer.
STACY: No, it’s not. We’ve got to let him cut the leg off.
HOUSE: It’s my leg. It’s my life.
STACY: Would you give up your leg to save my life?
HOUSE: Of course I would.
STACY: Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?
HOUSE: I would say it’s their choice.
STACY: Wha – not a chance! You’d browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You’d shove it in their face that it’s just a damn leg! You don’t think you deserve to live? You don’t think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? 
HOUSE: I can’t, I can’t, I’m sorry.
STACY: The pain alone is going to kill you.
HOUSE: I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor.

CUDDY: He change his mind?
STACY: No. He’s asked to be put in a chemically induced coma so he can sleep through the worst part of the pain.
CUDDY: We can do that.
STACY: What happens after he’s in the coma?
CUDDY: We’ll obviously monitor his condition closely, and if he can get through the next forty-eight hours without another cardiac incident –
STACY: I meant, I’m his health-care proxy, I get to make medical decisions for him if he’s not able to.
CUDDY: You should talk to him about what he wants to do.
STACY: I know what he wants, but if he’s out it’s my call, right? 

CUDDY: You’ll be out in less than a minute.
HOUSE: Thank you.  Hey.
STACY: Hey.
HOUSe: I’ll see you when I wake up. We’ll go golfing. I love you.
STACY: I love you, too. I’m sorry.
HOUSE:  You’ve got nothing to be sorry about. 
STACY: The middle ground you were talking about?
CUDDY: We go in, take out the dead muscle. There’s still some risk of reperfusion injury, but –
STACY: Give me the forms you need signed.
CUDDY: You’re saving his life.
STACY: He won’t see it that way.

HOUSE: Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the patient’s leg was severely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, patient continues to experience chronic pain.
CARING: She had no right to do that.
REBELLIOUS: She had the proxy.
CARING: She knew he didn’t want the surgery.
REBELLIOUS: She saved his life!
KEEN: Well, we don’t know that. Maybe he would have been fine –
CARING: It doesn’t matter. It’s the patient’s call.
REBELLIOUS: The patient’s an idiot.
HOUSE:  They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?
CUDDY:  Twenty minutes ago.
HOUSE: I’m not doing this again.  And this guy is not the world’s greatest dad. Not even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That’s why he’s always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. 

HOUSE: Stacy, it’s Gregg. I’ve got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn’t late. If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go out alone
Don't think I'll understand

(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me
In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in-betweens
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me
You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you wake one day in your own world
'Cuz when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries in your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell back in your own world
(Stay) Stay with me

You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh


Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh
Ooh!I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A
When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
And I say, "Send me picture postcards from L.A
"Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun"
When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say
I say, "Send me picture postcards from L.A
"Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun"
Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, "Next week, I'm gonna go."
She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay
And still no picture postcards from L.A
"Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun"
I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a starOoh, ooh, ooh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Sorry didn't notice you there
Then again you didn't notice me
So we'll remain passers by
Until the next time we speak
I hope that I can make you mine
'Fore another man steals your heart
And once your beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name
I'm hoping I can make you mine (Yes I)
'Fore another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart (Oh, sing)

It didn't take much time to think about
But I didn't want to move too fast
'Cause I knew that when I saw you again
That I wouldn't wanna let you pass
'Cause my eyes have seen the glory
In the coming of your smile
So I swear if you ever come 'round again
Please stay for a while

Walks by me every day
(Ooh, baby, baby)
Her and love are the same
(Her and love are the same)
The woman that's stolen my heart
(Whoa, oh oh oh)
And beauty is her name (I'm hoping)

You are so beautiful
When I'm down and out (When I'm down)
I never seem to get tired...
(Tired of your love, ooh, tired of your love)
...of your love
('Cause you are wonderful)
You're wonderful
I'm just dying to make you see
Anything you want inside your heart
(You can find right here inside of me)

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
(I don't think you hear me)
And beauty is her name

Wayniac (What's up?), I think we oughta check it
For a second straight record for them fools disrespectin
(Disrespect what?) the flow
And being the Tripp Locc, I just can't take it no more
(so?), let me televise my shit the underground
MTV, the Box, BET it's still hits
24-7 eastsidein' it, G ridin
We slidin, bomb to the fullest, fuck hidin' it
You know what's up wit' me the dollar bill and my steal
I play for keeps, that's on the real

Now get the glass and the yak and take a step back
And try to figure out this nigga Wayniac, the maniac
When it comes to a track
It's like this, or should I say it's like that (like that)
I got that knack to make the beats smack
From my nine-millimeter microphone Mack
10-9-8-wait-B-e-a-c-h, city is the place to be
With my brother Tripp Locc and the G funk family

We just doin' our thang, straight up, it's fixin' to hit the fan
Serious like that cuz some ain't goin understand
Anticipation got'em all on the sack
All my time that I gotta spin up that track
Money got me motivated, word up to my moms
Nine-four set it up so now it's time for the bomb
To get dropped, non-stop on my way to the T-O-P
Servin' conversation, as if it were some cavi

You could tell I was a hustla from the start
Which meant the Locc and me could never ever see a mark
Cuz sippin-ass niggas wear them pumps to get fed
Bitches steady gankin' while they puffin' up your head
Since I'm the Loc they come and show we just chillin
Peepin out my whole click I'm wit make a killin
You know me I'm the one that will always make'em pay
But for now I'ma slide and listen to the women as they say

Catch a grip young Tripp, that's what they told me
I gotta thank god for all my true homies
You molded me, into a true G
That's how I put it down (That's right) with Tripnology
And dissocology from G to G
Helps a nigga like me see clearly
I'm tellin' you the truth with proof
It's like a pimp tryin to pimp some hoes with no coupe
(you know how that go) Stoop down (Down)
And listen to the look alike, dynamite, trump tight twins
From the P-A-C
Poly Apartments for them niggas that ain't from the LBCOh, baby, I found heaven when I found you
And this heaven is somethin' I don't wanna lose
I only know that if you ever said goodbye, I couldn't stand the pain
These eyes would cry, cry, cry like the rain
And the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know
And I'd lose my whole world if you go
Baby, don't
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
Oh, baby, I saw forever when I saw you
And if you left me, I can't imagine what I'd do
Now that I've gone and built my world around your love, I couldn't let you go
Don't ever say goodbye, no, don't, don't, don't ever go
'Cause the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know)
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go)
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
'Cause you might as well take my life from me
What good would a life without you be anyway (Anyway)
If you go away
Well, the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky (From the sky)
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know)
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go)
Baby, don't, no
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
Don't take away my heaven, don't take away your love
Don't take away my world 'cause baby, I need your touch
Baby, don't
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
Please don't take away my heaven
Please
Baby, don't, oh, no
Don't take away my heaven, oh...
Don't take away my heaven, don't take away your love
Don't take away my world 'cause baby, I need your touch
Baby, don't, oh
Don't take away my heaven, oh, noWho da hell you think you messin' wit
Tryin' to play me like a fool
I overheard a conversation
Between your ex-girlfriend and you
Then I saw it so clearly
Suddenly it all made since
Before you go on explaining yourself
Let me explain my evidence

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I felt like you was hiding something
When you started showering alone
And someone used my Chanel perfume
Since this moment when I left home
You tiptoeing in the bedroom
While your thinking i'm asleep
If I catch your ass in one more lie
I'll be telling you to leave

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

He say, she say
You got our business all up in the streets cheatin'
He say, she say
Everyone knows us like we're on t.v

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shitWe used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away

And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love meEurus

So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue


If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue

If all you told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed was new
Imagine sky high above
In Caribbean blue

Every window in my hometown is empty
And I really don't know why
And the house you used to live in
Is cold and falling down
And I am tired and I'm weary
And Lord those gray skies bring me down
And I came home for just one reason
To find myself in this quiet town (yeah)
And I'm thinking. . 
(chorus)
Oh I'm thinking time's been my teacher
I don't want to leave you
So please give me one more try
I'm tired and I'm weary but I want you near me
So please give me one more try
Oh, just give me one more try
One more try
Oh I don't know where to go for
One more try
(verse 2)
All the days we spent together doing nothing
It all seems so long ago
I thought the world turned around without me baby
But I just didn't know oh
That I was wrong to go and leave you
To go and leave your world behind
But now time has been my teacher
And now I finally found
(chorus)
Oh I'm thinking time's been my teacher
I don't want to leave you
So please give me one more try
I'm tired and I'm weary but I want you near me
So please give me one more try
Oh, just give me one more try
One more try
Oh I don't know what to do
One more try
(chorus until out)Hitched a ride to the peaceful side of town
Then proceeded where thieves were no longer found
Can't crash now I've been waiting for this
Won't crash now I found some encouragement
Precious declaration reads
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
New meanings to the words I feed upon
Wake within my veins elements of freedom
Can't break now I've been living for this
Won't break now I'm cleansed with hopefulness
Precious declaration says
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
Once I jumped thru hoops of fire
High and far as you required
I was blind but now I see
Salvation has discovered meIt's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotised, I feel paralysed
I have found heaven

There's a thousand reasons why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
To keep me hanging on feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied, I belong inside
Your velvet heaven

Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this?
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss?
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
Before I could even start to understand?

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myselfYeah, I can't deny it
On the inside, I'm slowly dying
But with a little love, it'll be alright
Just give me one more day
I promise I'll make it up to you
I never meant to hurt you, baby
Just trust me, listen

I can't deny it, that you got me crying, you see
And I'm, I'm slowly dying, so we can't give up trying to be
With a little love, it will be all right
With a little kiss, let me hold you tight
With a little peace, it could be fine
And baby, don't you leave me tonight

I just need one more day, and I won't make you cry
Darling believe, and baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart, and I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day, and loving me will be fine

People tell me that true love is blind
But I'm trying to prove that true love is kind
All that I want is to make things right
So won't you be my baby tonight

I just need one more day, and I won't make you cry
Darling believe, and baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart, and I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day, and loving me will be fine

One more day (one more day, one more day)
One more day (one more day, one more day)
One more day (one more day, one more day)
One more day (one more day, one more day)
With a little love it will be all right
With a little kiss let me hold you tight
With a little peace it could be fine
And baby don't you leave me tonight
I just need one more day

Just one more day
Just one more day
Just one more day

So move on over
I'm the DJ's girlHere I am at another dead end
Stopped in my tracks again
Closer then I've been to where I wanna be
A broken heart standing in my way
Big as life on a real bad day
Making lemons into lemonade
Ain't nothing new to me No
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
Now looking back I realize
How hard it is to recognize
Opportunity in disguise
That's some Calamity
So I ain't gonna cuss my luck
Every time a door slams shut
I know a window's gonna open up
Just as long as I believe
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
Stepping Stone.. Ohhh
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It's just a stepping
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
This ain't no stumbling block
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping, stepping stone

Changing Faces

How we do
Yo, all of my rhymes for all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Kill the late nights cruisin'
All you see is the brake lights, and hair blowin'
You know where we goin'
Or at the club in the rear frontin', poppin', droppin'
The amount some cats will wear, ain't trying to hear nothin'
Probably was wilder than Bobby, are you the Whitney to get me Hold me down and make me slow down the V-twizzy?
Keep the ice out the club lights change faces
Get I love wifey on the license plate
Wait, make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down
Cop you some sprinkles the hound with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep you jiggy all of my days, uh huh

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' 'bout you babe
Got me dreamin' 'bout you baby

All that I have
(All that I have)
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby

Anything that turn you on
I'll be givin' it to you babe
You don't have to worry baby

All that I have
(All that I have)
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby

Yeah ha ha, check it
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life, loving me
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life (Uh huh)
Loving me

Now we going house shoppin'
Everybody wanna know the price your spouse droppin'
Keep that on the low R. Kelly style, it's quite shockin'
A year ago, all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockings
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle, rice droppin'
Got you a nice rock and...
Now it's on and poppin', droppin' hotter than platinum bracelets
Jigga, R. Kelly, Changing Faces, uhh

All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby(Originally by Portishead)
To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday
Oh these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
After time the bitter taste
Of innocence, decent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide ....
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you
Nobody loves.. me
It's true
Not, like, you.. doBreakdown!

I gets so busy on the mic with my rythmic flows
That's bound to leave you bangin' when it gets exposed
'Cause the way I could display my style is wicked
So run up to your counters, and go and get your tickets
I know you got dreams of roasting me hot
But I got flavor like that candy in your grocery shop
The dramatical, craft-matical, soul fanatic
An addict, with the crazy flow that's automatic
Flowin' like them bolts from the sky like Zeus
An old schooler, who drops mathematics like a ruler
Or protractor, you don't have no knack to
Hang with me, come with the steez and see I'm no actor
That shit is real homeslice, so bring your own dice
So we call roll, gonna lose, I'm takin' all your dough
Punch you in your eye and come raid your town
With the sound full of spunk as we break it down
'Cause it's...

Ah, ah, aah, achoo!
What to do? Timbuck-one, timbuck-two
I can't see a t'ing like Mr. Magoo
The sniffling, huh-huh-ha
C-c-c-coughing, achoo!
Stuffy, naughty, nappy jack-in-a-box, dreadlocks rocks
So na, hic-up, na, hic, what's up? Tic-tic-tock, oops!
Shiver me Timberland boots
Oh my gosh, oh my goose
Shucks, yo now I huh, now I huh, eeh, got the hic-ups
And I rips up many tracks, jumpin' Jehoshaphat
Don't make a sound, I see you wabbit
Tracks, like thunder and lightning
My style frightening, can't you tell?
I'm loco, ooh, they don't know me very well, so
I lumps 'em, eeh, bruise 'em with black eyes and stitches
They're mad, keeh, 'cause we went from rags into riches
Now my scruples, I lose 'em
Damage, I do some
I'm two-faced kid, so call me the gruesome two-some
I got secrets, but I don't know
Like Yoko, I'm Ono
I'm changing, visions blurry, so call me, I'm Quasimoto
And yo, I'll switch up, hic-up!
Switch up, hic-up!
Switch up, hic-up!
Switch-up, hii!
With or without the hic-ups, those emcees quickly pack up
Then I freaks my Fu-Schnick style wild to the microphone
Yo, peep it
And I freaks it, hic-up!
Freaks it, hic-up!
When I freaks it with my drunken technique
I'm makin' pips squeak
But now it's back to the lagoon, way up shit's creek
And don't sleep, when it's time to creep
We roll mad deep, and if the shit gets kind of thick
Here comes the five six fleet to break you down

The funk makes me tipsy, got the whisky
Yo, can this be the funkdafied horror
Tomorrow I'll flip tip
See, er, the blur in my eyes rectifies
That the funk freak me, so peep me as I speak the grammar
I rocks my bandana, shave my head clean
And on my screens than Vanna White
How should I roll when I write?
Then light the spliff, now it's time to recite
A verse, a hearse you be leavin' in
Believe me when I say what I feel, and it's real, not like TV
And science fiction, my addiction is the funk
With more fumes than a skunk, 'cause I'm bound to jump
So check the sound

You're like a long, cool glass of lemonade
Bitter, sweet and I want you so bad it hurts
You complete my life
And you quench my thirst, sexy
Sexy feelings just come over me
Playing with my dress like a summer breeze
Gentle as the touch of a falling leaf
You open me up to love
Now I gotta believe, gotta believe

Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
It's the least that I can do
What you've given me, given me

'Cause I'm cool, crazy cool
Crazy cool with you
In this groove
Crazy groove
Baby act a fool
Hey I'm cool
Crazy cool
You're crazy cool with me
In this groove
Crazy cool
Everything you need, sexy

Laying in the grass
Writing poetry
Looking up at the midnight sun
While you're making love to me
You showed me just how cool
Crazy cool can be
Now I know meaning of ecstasy, ecstasy

Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
It's the least that I can do
What you've given me, given me

'Cause I'm cool, crazy cool
Crazy cool with you

Love is all we need
The color of love
I have been watching you all night

ChorusYeah, what I want you to do tonight
Is turn your the stereo up real loud
Now for all the fellas out there getting their groove on
And for all the ladies out there getting on with the groove
This one goes out to you, yeah

Would you mind
If I kiss your lips a thousand times
Would you mind
And baby would you mind
If I could just sit here
Take my time
Would you mind
Oh, baby

Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before

Would you mind
If I run my fingers through your hair, baby
Would it show you how much I care
And would you mind
If I made you scream my name out loud, babe
The thought of it just drives me wild

Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before

Come and go with me
Girl then you will see
I wanna love you now
Make your body spin around and around and around and around

Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone beforeWell, I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I try to dance with
What life has to hand me
My partner's been pleasure
My partner's been pain
There are days
When I swear I could
Fly like an eagle
And dark desperate hours
That nobody sees
My arms stretched triumphant
On top of the mountain
My head in my hands
Down on my knees
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
I've reached in darkness
And come out with treasure
I've laid down with love
And I woke up with lies
What's it all worth
Only the heart can measure
It's not what's in the mirror
But what's left inside
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
You gotta take it as it comes
Sometimes it don't come easy
I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
And I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I tried to dance with
What life had to hand me
And if I could
I'd do it all over again
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes the picture
Just ain't what it seems
You get what you want
But it's not what you need
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Well it's a breeze
It's a breeze, it's a breezeTo the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (Don't stop)

Yo, you niggedy-know that I'm back, man
You're wack man, I eat a rapper like I'm Pac Man

I swell a, nigga in his eye if he test me
You don't impress me, a-yo Books kick the rest, G
Uhh, one time for your mind...

Ayo, what up? It's the crew bringing the ruckus, no doubt
We's the roughest dream team, Reign Supreme like a Cutlass
Getting duckets, the dough, you can't touch the flow
It's me, the nigga wit' G, the B double O K-S
So say yes and bust your caliber
When I pop shit and rock shit like Metallica
Stakes through the hearts of them snake fake niggas

You're in my Dangerfield like Rodney
Howdy, I'll back up in that ass, G, kaplowie
And now we got the game to a Tee like Howie
Allow me, to introduce myself and my peeps
Straight from the sewer, stayin' true to the streets

Well, it's me, Krazy Drayz, bringin' up the rear
I swear, we got to Hold It Down e'ry year
So there, let me crack a beer and kick my feet up
Turn the heat up and smiggedy-smoke all the weed up
Kids I eat up, wit' a style that's the newest
My crew is, getting more run than Carl Lewis
It's from the sewers now ya see me on the top
So stop and recognize the niggas on ya block

Ayo, MC's is irrelevant, and delicate to the texture
But this style of mine is well defined like Webster
Ain’t a badder nigga raw from the jaw than the Jabber-Jibber
When I get Stone like Sharon from Sliver
Equipped to riggedy-rip the microphone to shreds
Dread, yo come and hit these niggas in the head

Well I connect my rhymes like Lego, so l'eggo my Eggo
I burn ya like Waco, you need more than Maaco
I take it to ya crew and keep 'em moving like I'm U-Haul
I'm here to school y'all figgedy-faggots like RuPaul
I throw a screwball and strike out the MC
And if he temps me, I knock em out like Jack Dempsey
I burn some sensi and chase it wit' a Guinness
The illest, now hit me with the hook because I'm finished

To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (Don't stop)

For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring

Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep

Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring

Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep

Holy Moses our hearts are screaming
Souls are lifting only dreaming
We'll be waiting some are praying
For a time when no one's cheatin'

The sunlight rising over the horizon
Just a distant memory the dawn chorus
Birds singing bells ringing
In our hearts in our minds...

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep4/1

So you're packin' your bags and you're leaving?
But that ain't right
You need to stay a while, think about it
But wait a minute, before you go
There's just one thing I want you to know

We both agree that this love ain't what it used to be
We just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you, baby
Girl, you'll always be my heart
It's gonna to be strange living without you
Ain't felt so empty before, no
See, I miss your smile and even your fussin'
When I left my clothes on the floor, oh, baby, say now

I'm gonna miss your face (Yes, I am, baby)
I'm gonna miss your moods (The little things you do when you're sad and blue, baby)
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you (Yeah, yeah, I'm already missing you)

It's hard to say goodbye (Goodbye), but things will be better
You go your way and I will go mine
Let's keep in touch, let me know how you're doing
Girl, things will change in time, said
Don't want you to leave, keep sayin' I'm sorry
But I guess I'm repeating myself
Girl, you know I'm here when you need a shoulder
I can't see you in the arms of someone else, oh, baby

I'm gonna miss your face (Such a pretty face, such a pretty face)
I'm gonna miss your moods (How you do what you do when you do it)
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you (Missin' you)
I'm gonna miss your face (Oh, yes I am, yes I am, baby)
I'm gonna miss your moods (I'm gonna miss your love, miss your love)
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you (I'll miss makin' love to you)
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you (I'm missin' you)

Already missin' you (Right now)
See, I know you're leavin' soon, baby
Already missin' you (Right now)
And I don't think I can live without you, baby, yeah, sun set (Oh, baby)
Even though you haven't gone (Even though you haven't gone yet)
I'm missin' you (Uh-huh)
Gonna cry, I'm gonna be lonely
Missin' you, baby (Goodbye, baby)
Funny face, funny face (Baby, baby)
I know 'cause it's your style (I'll miss your touch)
You know I see your face (I miss your lovin')
I know you're gettin' ready to leave
Not a thing gonna make me happy
The way I miss your style, baby (I miss you, babe)
I never thought you'd leave me, baby
I never thought you'd go
It's gonna be strange livin' without you, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
You know my name when you need a shoulder
I'll miss you, baby (To cry on)
I'll miss you, girl
I'll miss you, sugar
I'll miss you, girl
I'll miss your smilin', baby
Smile for me, baby
Before you leave, before you leave
Smile, girl
Smile, baby
Smile, girlAh send you my love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that you knows it's
From the bottom of my heart
Ah way we say
Ah send you my love
Don't hold back your feelings
There's so many reasons
Why we shouldn't be apart
Ah way we say
For all o' y'all though we livin' in hell
Come ketch di vibes as B.J's excel
'Pon a musical selection with a slight rendition
Of a wonder if will make ya all reminisce

The very essence of life will make your whole future bright
And no Kris neither Kross but tonight ah di night

Hi Ye-eh-eh eh-eh-eh-eh
Party up, Party up, Party up, Party up
Party up, Party up, Da da-a, a a-a-aWords of silence echo through this lonely room
Just a photograph and dreams that won't come true
I'll never know why I left you standin' in the rain
Cryin' tears of emptyness it's drivin' me insane
All I wanted was to love you
Never wanted to see you cry
All I need is just to hold you
I just can't say - Goodbye
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
You use words as weapons I use love as a shield
So tell me why are we on this battlefield
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down your arms and baby let's surrender
And thought my aim is true
I sometimes miss the mark
Ooh, in matters of the heart
But I'd give my life tonight
To hold you in my arms
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way
I just wanna hold you (surrender)
I just wanna love you (surrender)
I never meant to make you cry
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers of from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down you arms and baby let's surrenderSpecial technique- (Nigga, fuck that)
Spe-special technique of shadowboxin' (Goddamn)
The GZA, uh, goddamn (Uh, the GZA)
Pledge allegiance to the hip-hop (Uh, goddamn, the Method, uh)
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop, allegiance to the hip-hop (Goddamn, Maximillion, Maximillion, uh)
Yeah, yeah (Uh)
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop (What?)
Maximillion, Maximillion, Maximillion

I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speakin' scud missile, heat-seekin'
Johnny Blazin', nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozin'
Slip the cardiac, arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez
Burnin' to the third degree
Sneaky ass alley cat, top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin (That's right, all you corny-ass rap motherfuckers)
The special technique of shadowboxing (Better go back and check your fucking stacks)
Because your naps ain't nappy enough (Shadowboxing)
And your reach ain't rugged enough, bitch

Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now
Things are gettin' good, lookin' better now
...and some other shit

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special, special, special, special technique of shadowboxing
Shadowboxing
Allow me to demonstrate the—Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't "Gone with the Wind" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(chorus)

Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(Chorus)I know you're thinking
I've been better off without you by my side
But baby, this season
I don't want another cold rainy July

You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
Cause I don't have you
You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
Cause I don't have you

Come back to the world
Come back to the world
Baby, back to my world

And I still remember
The way you used to gently touch my face
And since last December
I've discovered that no one can take your place



And when the nights get lonely
I think of what you told me
Saying that I was the one
La, do, day
La, do, doh
La, do, day
La, do, doh
Tell me you can feel it once again
I know that we can love
Like we did then
So, bring it on homeHe was working through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now, years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much?

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wineAmerican woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama, let me be

Don't come hanging around my door
I don't want to see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growing old with you

Now woman, stay away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama, let me be

Don't come knocking around my door
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, said get away from me
American woman, listen what I say

Don't come hanging around my door
Don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

I gotta go, I gotta get away
Baby, I gotta go, I wanna fly away
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
A-bye-bye, a-bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye

(American woman) You're no good for me and I'm no good for you
(American woman) I look you right straight in the eye and tell you what I'm gonna do
(American woman) I'm going to leave you, woman, you know I got to go
(American woman) I'm going to leave you woman, I got to go
(American woman) I got to go
I gotta go, American woman, yeahIn my life, I feel so lucky
I've seen chances come and go
But reality has really struck me
I took advantage, hurt you so

I never knew a love so sweet
Could knock me off my feet
But now I'm happy, baby
Since I met you
I never knew a love so strong
Could actually turn me on
But now I'm happy, baby
Since I met you

There'll never be another
Another like my lover
There'll never be another like my lover
There'll never be another
Another like my lover
Say there'll never-never be
Another-nother love like my lover

Boy, you've got to believe me
Let's finish up where we started
Boy, you've got to forgive me
'Cause I never meant to break your heart
No!

 (2x)
Give it up!

Do you still want me?
Do you still want me?
 (2x)
I'll be your ladyShadow let go
There's something you should know
I just found my new direction
And I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it
She's like the wind that sucked me through it
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me
Stand back - get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection
Got a resurrection feel
When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
And I go blind
Wasting my time
While the rivers in front of me
That's where I'm goin' to be
Shine on, get on
Twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the spirit of creation
She's the last chance guarantee
Got a myriad of poses
Sweet miracles and roses
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
'Cause when I find
My state of mind
The river's in front of me
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon
My nerves just feel electrified
Meet me on the staircase
Outside a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame
The voice of Mother Nature states
All things must pass
And nothing can remain
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
You raise me like a building to the very top
Rush me to the end of time
You fill me full of danger
You give me future shock
Then you leave me wasted dying
And I go blind
Wasting my time
The river's in front of meI'm in need of a remedy To cure me from loving you
It may sound a little extreme I'll do what I have to do
Chorus:
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
Keep walking till the hurting stops
Keep walking till my temperature drops
Keep walking till the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones
I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones
Sweet amnesia come and set me free
I just need to get you out of meIntro : (Flavor Flav)
To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say "How Breed?" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)
There ain't no future in your frontin'

I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at 
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', "Eric Breed is gettin' over"
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'
Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that
(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors
Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Hey man, let's start this party up, right?
(Beat y'all)
(Keep on)If you are not already, please get drunk before listening to this song
Part 1

Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!

I need something to draw, need something to write on
I see electricity in the pylons
Look at it running the race, everything you doing erased
What it feel like? Hit with the mace
Tight pace that I'm keeping, got the reaper on me
Like you, what the hell would I be?
Without it, if you think it, shout it
Lost my mind, i think I found it, away
Live to fight, another bright day
I am God, so why would I pray?
You are God, above a white page
The creator, maker of rage
Painter paint the canvas, I ate the mantis
I saved the pandas, I hate they brand us
Can us like some Campbells
Jesus had no socks under his sandals
I can't ride a bike without the handles
I can't ride a scooter, have a tutor
Shoot the Buddha, eat some gouda
Say it ruder, tell who did I trample
Ramble on about some nonsense, I'm unconscious
I don't have cricket for a conscience
Kelp forest, where the magic conch is
Violent crucifying like I'm Pontius
Pilot flying high above Olympus
She's an angel, give that bitch a nimbus
Bengal tiger biting off your fingers
How am I supposed to eat these Pringles?
Image in your head is how I want it
Finish on the bed and lie upon it

Right on (Yuh, yuh)
Right on (Yuh, yuh)
Right on (Yuh, yuh)
Right on (Yuh, yuh)
Right on (Yuh, yuh)
Right on (Yuh, yuh)
On (Woah)
(Yuh, yuh)
Part 2

Lil Darkie
Just might give a fuck
Lil Darkie!
Just might give a fuck
Spider Gang

In the car, I'm moving fast
Foot up on the gas
Everything we tend to pass
Leave it in the past
I know what my momma asked
I just didn't answer
Got her foot up on the dash
She my tiny dancer

She my tiny dancer
Move it hula girl
Not a girl with cuter curls
I'ma stack these commas
We could be like the Obamas (Huh)
We could rule the world
Baby girl, just pick a country
Ain't worried bout no money
Ain't worried bout no-
-fast

Foot up on the gas
Everything we tend to pass
Leave it in the past
I know what my momma asked
I just didn't answer
Got her foot up on the dash
She my tiny dancer

Breakin-breaking down the gas
Don't want, smoke want cancer
You could-you could-you could ask
You can't get me canceled
Shake it-shake it-shake your ass
How it in your pants too?
How he do it?
You could ask
Grip this pen no pencil
Baby-baby-baby girl
Shake that ass for a nigga, I'll give you the world
Man, I love it how you bend your back and make it curl
Yeah, I put that necklace on yo' shit like pearls
Yeah, I cook that rock I stir it, make it twirl
Part 3

Yuh
I got a story for y'all (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, I do, I do, I do)
But I gotta kinda build it up a little bit (Lil bit, lil bit, lil bit)
I've been having a lot of bad dreams lately (I have, I have, I have)
And no matter what the fuck I do they won't go away
(They won't, they won't, they won't)
So I'ma talk about the place in my brain that I think they stay

Look
I had a dream about that nigga there in that photo (Okay, okay)
I had a dream that I shot you and yo' niggas in that photo
And it ain't right, bad dreams clouding up my sight
Can't get any rest in the night
Why the hell when I close my eyes am I not surprised? Someone always dies
Why the hell when when I close my pupils someone you lose comes to life
There ain't shit to fight, there ain't shit to point at with the pipe
Somethin' in my mental isn't right
Maybe it's all the hatin' ass niggas talkin' to me every day
About how the fuck they got a problem with what I be doin'
Maybe it's this hatin' ass bitch tellin' Lil Darkie not to say
The n-word even though she ain't knew him
And I'm always talking about spreadin' love and positivity
So maybe it's a little hard for me to put that shit behind me, and say screw 'em
Or lawyer up and go sue 'em, what am I doin'?
It's hard for me to let go of the hate
Especially when I want you to do great
Especially when them fuckers stall my fate
And you distractin' me because you ain't
Wit' it now my brain say slit it, take yo' blood and paint wit' it
Do it 'till you faint, do it 'till you can't anymore
I'll do this 'till I can't anymore
Is that my blood, or the paint on the floor?
Is that my blood, or the paint on the floor
I'm just a person who's mental state
Tend to worsen now I'm cursin' on a track
Oh you wear a beanie? That jack is my night cap
I'm spittin' heavy you ain't ready insider you might crack
I knew a mother of one son, one daughter, liked crack
She was my friend, she got kicked out of her apartment
For bringing the children harm, and it's scarring
My brain alarmin', I saw it
Her husband drink until he barely was thinking
They like my music though (Oh, we love your music!)
I see you got them bodies but you ain't actin' a human though
How you let your kids see you separate then abuse 'em though?
Momma smokin' cigs on the corner and daddy boozin' mo'
Now that bitch a racist 'cause her husband is
Fuckin' wit' darker faces, ain't puttin' dick where her waist is
And she can't afford no braces to give her daughter some teeth
But she talking to one my friends
About how she would suck his dick if he drove her to ATM
So she the pullin' the money out and she spendin' it all on coke
Now she broker and want it back so she switchin' over to crack
I rap about whippin' rock but I never do that for real
'Cause it's funny just when you talk and it's not when you skippin' meals
And it's not when your skin, it peels
And it's, not when you makin' deals
And it's not when you got the cops taking children away it feels
Too close to home
Part 4

Tell us another one, Darkie...
I'll try
(No ad-libs)
Fuck
Yuh
Yeah, yeah
Uh

Back in high school, uh, I had this girl
She meant the world to a nigga, that's a pearl, that's a gem
In the end, she ended up wit' my friend
Now let me tell you how this steaming pile of bullshit began
Back in sophomore year, I couldn't drop more tears (Uh)
Because my last girl kicked me to the curb, not in the city in the 'burbs
I'm sittin' pretty with the birds, finally over that shit
Uh, will anybody love me? Pulling clovers I rip, them out
In PE I'm sittin' out, but she just wanna talk
She invite me to her crib after class, okay, why not?
I'm door knockin', but she took me inside, led me to her room
Uh, then she pulled off all my clothes without askin' me she assumed I was for it
I should have known right there, mission abort it
Ain't no relationship she want, she want dick and she looking for it
She said, "Did you bring the condoms" as if I had caused a problem
I'm lying naked on her bed feeling raped and fucked in the head
So she apologized, "I'm just into taller guys"
She said that she was in the wrong, and I shouldn't tell anyone
So I forgave her, first mistake
It's hard to say it when you love someone that person fake
Mistook attention for true love and so we start to date
I'm with the bitch for two years and it's perfect, wait
It's senior year and she telling me she want smoke
And do drugs like the lean and coke
And she thinkin' that datin' me it prevent her from bein' free
I'm like "Baby, what do you mean? I been giving you everything
I been living my life for you, I thought we were part of a team?"
And so she leave, and my homie tell me I'll be fine, and that he really feel me
Dealing poorly start to smoke a lot, now I'm a fucking greenie
Caught a case, so she definitely stay away, no free me
At lunch I see her wit' him and I know that he can see me
Hoe meet me at the bike racks, fight back
You bony piece of shit, you was my homie, I ain't know that it was like that
But that nigga might be the reason that I write raps
Hope my Indian fingers might put a divot in yo' white ass
Uh, bullied in middle school and bullied after I did time
Commit crimes, I ain't worried 'bout fuckin', I want that money and I lick minds
Bumpin' ScHoolboy Q, having some sick times
Sellin' weed, and you know you my nigga if you get big dimes
I was born from the darkness, once an innocent kid, spray paintin' where the park is
Don't go swimmin' where the shark is
(Well, I hope you enjoyed that story of my youth
Now it's time for this journey through my mind to come to an end
I hope you're ready)
Part 5

(Please keep all hands, arms, feet, and legs inside your thoughts at all times)

Troubled kid with the troubled mind, troubled kid with the troubled past
In the trouble I grew up fast, in the rubble I sit my ass down
I’ll smoke you like I smoke that grass, I broke him like I broke that glass, I dropped out ain't got no class
Had to cut off a lot of friends, had to cut off a lot of people
Cause lots of people round me were evil, cause lots of niggas were weak and feeble
Ommmmmm...
Thank God that I got out alive
My momma never lost faith in my mind

LET IT OUT
AAAAAAAAAH
LET IT OUT
AAAAAAAAAH
LET IT OUT
AAAAAAAAAH
LET IT OUT
AAAAAAAAAH
LET IT OUT
AAAAAAAAAH
LET IT OUT
AAAAAAAAAH
LET IT OUT

When I was young
I used to play with Legos 'till the morning sun
I used to play with Legos now it's boring, son
No one would play with me, I’m the foreign one
He ain't had no butthole, so I tore him one
I didn't know what a country was now I'm touring one
All I wanna do is get on tracks, I was born to run
In the field I grip that stick, it's a hole in one
Why would you commit a crime with a stolen gun?
Rat-a-tat-tat, grip that gat, and push his hat back
Is yo momma proud of you now?
No she's not this much is true now

Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!
Right on!

As you go, remember this:
Where there is Yin, there is always YangListen as the wind blows
From across the great divide
Voices trapped in yearning
Memories trapped in time
The night is my companion
And solitude my guide
Would I spend forever here
And not be satisfied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Through this world I stumble
So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved
Oh you speak to me in riddles
And you speak to me in rhymes
My body aches to breathe your breath
Your words keep me alive

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Into this night I wander
It's morning that I dread
Another day of knowing of
The path I fear to tread
Oh into the sea of waking dreams
I follow without pride
It's nothing stands between us here
And I won't be denied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear
I hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyesShe's addicted to nicotine patches
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is?
Here, here, here

She's convinced she could hold back a glacier
(Between cotton balls and xylophones)
But she couldn't keep baby alive
(I'm getting old)
Doubting if there's a woman in there somewhere
Here, here, here

You say you don't want it, again and again
But you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it, the circus we're in
But you don't, don't really mean it
You don't, don't really mean it

If the divine master's plan is perfection
(Swing low)
Maybe next I'll give Judas a try
(Swing low, sweet chariot)
Trusting my soul to the ice cream assassin
Here, here, here

You say you don't want it, again and again
But you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it, the circus we're in
But you don't, don't really mean it
You don't, don't really mean it

How many fates turn around in the overtime?
Ballerinas that have fins that you'll never find
You thought that you were the bomb, yes, well so did I
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
How many fates turn around in the overtime?
Ballerinas that have fins that you'll never find
You thought that you were the bomb, yes, well so did I
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it

Say you don't want it, again and again
But you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it, the circus we're in
But you don't, don't really mean it
You don't, don't really mean it

She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is?
Here, here, hereCan't ignore or hide away
Can't escape from the things that line our way
Take it, leave it, break it
Anyway, you can't get back to yesterday
All I want, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
You better listen from now on
Confidence, coincidence, call it a sin
It's just like people say
Tomorrow's here so open up your eyes
And never hesitate
All I want, all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on
It makes me want to give you everything
Pick you up and take you home again
Hold you tight and think that now is then
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Open arms or crying eyes
Say hello or wave goodbye
Which one are you thinking of?
All I want, all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
From now on
It's all I wanna do, all I wanna say
You better listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on
All I want do, all I want to say
Is everything I feel from now onI've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it is time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say that you love me
But if you don't
Just let me go
Chorus:
'Cuz teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to hold you, touch you
Don't think that you're mine
Because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl whose teacher has told
Her goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at you feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
(chorus)
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more tryI've been doing a lot of thinking
And I know I was wrong
I know we belong together
Look, this is kind of hard
For me to say to you
But I want you back, please
Just give me a second chance
I'm tired of living alone
The single life is not for me
Like a fool, I asked you for my freedom
I didn't think you'd leave so easily
Saw you just the other day
You were walking hand in hand
With someone new
It took me by surprise
And then, I realized
How much I needed you

A second chance for us
The second time could be better, baby
A second chance for love
This time around
We could make it, baby
Turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine
Ooh, we were so happy together
I never thought that I would
Swallow my pride
Now you're here
So please stay the night
I promise I will make it up to you
Don't ever go away
This love we've got to save
Cause no one else will do, no one

I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone
Oh, oh, yeah, ah, ah, yeah
I'm not meant to live alone
Why you being so difficult
You know you want me back
Come on, baby
Why you wanna treat me like that
I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone, oh, oh

Oh, yeah, come on, baby
Love me like this
I just want to feel your kiss
Love me like thisYeah, sendin' this one out
To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?
That old real shit

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Open your eyes and get wise
Look alive, in '95, word up
Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed
Nomsayin? Mobb Deep and all thatAh shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked

Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check

Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for realAight now roll the track
Ugh yeah
Kick it, stick
Ugh astare
Vocals
It doesn't matter, what time of the day
Ask me what I'm thing about and it's you that I'm gonna say
Twenty-four seven, fifty-two, three sixty-five
Just wanted you to know how you stay on my mind

All I do is think of you honey you stay on my mind
All I do is speak of you honey you stay on my mind
All I do is dream of you honey you stay on my mind
All I do is think of you baby all the time
You've got something special worthy of my love
And I don't wanna let go, just keep on holdin' on
Oh you got me going, thoughts of me and you
And I can't help but talk about all the sexy things you do

(And it won't stop)The kissin' and the lovin'
The things you do to me you keep me satisfied
(And it don't stop)Let me give you my lovin'
Let me show you how much that I think about you every night

Now now now
I gotta admit you got me trippin alittle bit
Cause last week I caught you 6 times in one day
I was like damn, baby got me open alittle somethin' somethin'
But that's good cause you got a waiste like a wasp
And an ass like a hoss
Feels so good, got a nigga calling you the boss
To the end to the floor of my bed
That's right
Shit is tight like a man sittin' on dubbs
That's what it was and that's what it's gonna be
You know that I'm your freak
Call me up any time of the week
Before so I could come over there and put it down like a nigga supposed to
Yeah yeah that's what I'm talkin' bout

All I do is think of you honey you stay on my mindExcuse me, but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
Yeah, I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say, you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these years

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these

Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years

I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years(Mmm, mmm)
Enough of the break up (Yeah, hea)
Girl, let's deal with the make up
Alimony mean all the money
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Didn't I make you feel (Didn't I make you feel)
Like you were the only man (You were the only man)
The only man in you life
Didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can (Oh, yes I did)
But for all the love I gave ya
It's never enough (Not enough)
But I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough (So)
So come on, come on, come on, come on, and

So what, you have me under pressure
Despite the fact say in life you give me pleasure
I'm the only man and I possess the keys to you treasure
So give the contender on the trail
Captivate your mind, I'll make your heart grow fonder (Ooh..)
Still you're trying to find out whose covers that I'm under
So you start to wonder, heart beat like thunder (Yeah…)
So I blow my cover
'Cause I'm the great pretender, girl, surrender, yeah

(Take it) Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, oh, break it) Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Hey, darling, give it up, give it up, give it up
(Oh, oh, have it) Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good

You play detective boo, want a new suit
Going through my pockets, searchin' for clues
Trying to follow me, you and your desperate crew
The end of this relationship was long overdue
Now what you did was cute, girl, you spent the loot
Easy on the tears, oops, man, you soil my suit
Do yourself a favor and find a new recruit
And don't take it personal because you got the boot

You're out on the streets (Looking good) (Absolutely)
And you know deep down in you heart that that ain't right (Come on, come on)
And, oh, you never, never hear me when I cry at night (Oh…oh…oh…oh…oh…)
I tell myself, that I can stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms (Yeah) I sing it again (Say it again)
So come on, come on, come on, come on (So what?) and

(Take it) Take another little piece of my heart now, baby {Why don't you}
(Oh, oh, break it) Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
I don't think you know
(Oh, oh, have it) Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good

I can make you, ooh, you can make me ah
Anyway you want it, baby, we can do it right
Jump out a the frying pan and straight down in a the fire
I'm Mr. Gigolo, your most notorious liar
Ex-amount of loving you get what me did require, ooh
Your personal attendant, well, my love is not for hire
Girl, search yourself, 'cause I'm you heart's desire
25 girls in a my life, don't want a wife, I need a lover, yeah

(Take it) Take another little piece of my heart now, baby {Why don't you}
(Oh, oh, break it) Break another little bit of my heart now, honey

Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)

Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
That you've been trying to infiltrate my crew
It ain't no hiding from the Flava U
Don't get it confused, you ain't untouchable
(Go 'head and do it)
Now I've been trying to keep my cool like a queen
(Ooh, cool like a queen)
Bout to bring the Newark girl out of me
(Ooh, Newark outta me)

Don't you know I heard you trying to take my...
While I shine, y'all live them fake lives
Don't you know I heard you trying to take my...
While I shine, y'all live them fake ass lives
All around me
(Haters try to play La, but
They know that they can't take her paper)

Everybody talking see
Spreading them lies about my friends and me
They say that we're tighter than friends supposed to get
That's because I haven't let you chill with me yet
You make it hard for a girl to roll
(Ooh, girl to roll)
But make it easy so my pockets stay swole
(ooh, pockets stay swole)


That's right, yeah
Check it, check it, what
Check it, check it
Come on, come on
Yo, yo
Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at?
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at?

As I look back on my life (check it)
To get where I am, I had to sacrifice
You slander my name in your magazine
This business gets hard trying to stay the queen
You're checking for me, you need to check yourself
(Ooh, check yourself)
And be someone, not someone else
(Ooh, someone else)

(Flavor Unit, Refugee Camp All Stars)
Heard- Heard-
Heard you tryin' to take my (paper)
Heard- Heard-
Heard you tryin' to take my (paper)
(Why they wanna stick me for my…)This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (this thing), called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle at night
It swings, it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool, relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a backseat, hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love...The word "love" is a hell of a word to be sayin'
You don't know how to use it with caution
It's a death-defying game to play
And when you're thinking of the one you wanna get next to
Be sure it's a mutual feeling
'cause these are the words they'll say
"Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on"
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, "Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed"
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled
Who do you  love? (You have to ask yourself)
Is it someone you can count on?
Someone who's there for you
Someone who will be true
No matter what the situation may be
And are they sent from above?
This question is asked for a reason
'Cause some of them wanna play
And then go their separate ways
And hey, these are the words they'll say

"Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on"
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, "Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed"
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled

Ain't never had game, I shot real, shot real
'Cause complications in your conversation
So you know it ain't real, gotta be real
So why you keep fallin' for lames and games?
Shame shame shame
How many strippings you wanna take
Until you learn the game's another definition for play?
So, won't ya ease-a your mind and block out all distraction
Take your time
Take your time
Slow down  your action
Ya see, 'cause that's your disaster
Take your time
Ease my mind (Baby, won't you take your time?)
Take your time, help me ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find, I'm one of a kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misledI see your face cloud over like a little girl's
Your eyes have lost their shine
You whisper something softly I'm not meant to hear
Baby, tell me what's on your mind
I don't care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds
I love you so much that it hurts inside
Are you listening?
Listen to me, girl
Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fightin' for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
I love you so much, baby
That it tears me up inside
I hear you on the telephone with God knows who
Spillin' out your heart for free
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
Girl, that someone should be me
So many times I tried to tell you
You just turned away
(How did I know?)
My life is changing so fast now
Leaves me lonely and afraid
(Don't be afraid)
Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fightin' for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
I love you so much, baby
That it tears me up inside
Don't let our love fade away
(Don't let our love fade away)
No matter what people say
(No matter, no matter what they say)
'Cause I need you more and more each day
(Don't let our love fade away)
No matter what people say
(No matter, no matter what they say)
Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fightin' for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much, baby
That it tears me up inside
(It tears me up inside)
Can't we try just a little bit harder?
(Can't we try?)
Can't we give just a little bit more?
(A little bit more)
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fightin' for?
(Love we're fightin' for)
Can't we try just a little more passion?
(Baby, can't we try now?)
Can't we try just a little less pride?
(A little less pride)
Love you so much, baby
That it tears me up inside
(It tears me up inside)
Can't we try just a little bit harder?
(Can't we try?)
Can't we give just a little bit more?
(A little bit more)
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fightin' for?All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I am slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying, crying, crying
And you, don't you know the tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry
Oh, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray, oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
(How could I be so wrong?)
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know the hearts will cause an inferno?
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected
(I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you collected
Oh, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily?
Well, I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out over you
Oh, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you
(I'm all...)

Girl, it makes me feel so sad
Knowing you've been seeing
Some other guy that treats you bad
You know that I'm burning
Deep inside for you
Just give me the chance now
And we can see it through
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Gonna take me with you
Far away from hearts of stone
We'll live in the country
And raise some children of our own
I will be your lover
I will be your friend
I'll give you all my loving
On that you can depend
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
Take you to the city
Girl, we're gonna buy some clothes
Dress you up so pretty
Then we'll take in all the shows
Find a place that's jumping
Where the music's tight
And we'll keep on dancing till the morning light
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Be my woman, I'll be your man
Know I'm gonna give you everything I can
Be my woman, I'll be your man
There'll be no more running, gonna make a stand
