How can you tell me
How much you miss me
When the last time I saw you
You wouldn't even kiss me
That rich guy you've been seein'
Must have put you down
So welcome back baby
To the poor side of town
To him you were nothin'
But a little plaything (was a plaything, doo wah)
Not much more than
An overnight fling (overnight fling, doo wah)
To me you were the greatest thing
This boy had ever found
And girl it's hard to find nice things
On the poor side of town
I can't blame you for tryin'
I'm tryin' to make it too
I've got one little hang up, baby
I just can't make it without you (without you, without you)
So tell me
Are you gonna stay now (will you stay now, doo wah)
Will you stand by me girl
All the way now (all the way now, doo wah)
With you by my side
They can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town
(So tell me how much you love me)
(Come be near to me and say you need me now)
Oh, with you by my side
This world can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town
Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be
Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be
Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be
Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon
Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon
Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon
Blue Moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue Moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me."
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold, oh
Blue Moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Found some letters you wrote me this morning
They told of the love we once knew
Now they're gone I burned them to ashes
Don't want nothing to remind me of you
Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow
Sold the house we once planned together
Said goodbye to the folks we once knew
Then I moved to a far away city
Tried so hard to forget about you
Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow
Error
Every time you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Every time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care
Though you keep on saying
You really, really, really love me
Do you say the same words
To someone else when I'm not there

(Suspicion)
Torments my heart
(Suspicion)
Keeps us apart
(Suspicion)
Why torture me?

Every time you call me
And tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
You're meeting someone else tonight
Why should our romance just
Keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful
Whenever you are out of sight?
(Suspicion)
Torments my heart
(Suspicion)
Keeps us apart
(Suspicion)
Why torture me?

Darling, if you love me
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
These foolish fears out of my mind
Why can't our romance just
Keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious
'Cause true love is so hard to find

(Suspicion)
Torments my heart
(Suspicion)
Keeps us apart
(Suspicion)
Why torture me?
Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

I've got to stand tall, you know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears them passing by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad, that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses , that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown, that's Cathy's clown
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You were glad it was an even number
Everybody had another
No one was facing this cold alone
This cold alone, cold alone, cold alone
They were gathered between bridges
In the steely sunshine
Bookend by ice on either side
Here comes a pair on final approach
Wings like great white bellows
Gathering inward to land and it looks like grace
Looks like grace, looks like grace
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You were glad it was an even number
Everybody had another
No one was facing this cold alone
I thought you were right there with me
On my left side
Too eager to get where I'm going
I left you behind
But you were on the last watch
The passing of the torch
You counted 74 swans, now there's 75
Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy
First time that I saw you, girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you
With fellas hanging 'round you all the time
I want you for my sweet pet
But you keep playing hard to get
I'm going around in circles all the time
Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy
I finally got to talk to you
And I told you just exactly how I felt
Then I held you close to me
And kissed you and my heart began to melt
Girl, you've got control on me
'Cause I'm so dizzy I can't see
I need to call a doctor for some help
Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool it never ends
And it's you girl making it spin
You're making me dizzy
You're making me dizzy
I'm so dizzy
You're making me dizzy

Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy, lovin's twice as tough
So come back, baby, when you grow up
You look real good like a woman now
Your mind hasn't gotten the message somehow
So if you can't take it 'n' the goin' gets rough
Come back, baby, when you grow up
I want you girl but your wide-eyed innocence
Has really messed up my mind, yeah-eah-eah
I'd rather you get your very first heartbreak
Somewhere else along the line
Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Some day be a woman ready to love
Come back, baby, when you grow up
Come back when you grow up, girl
You've still got a lotta time left in the world
You'll some day be a woman ready to love
Come back, baby, when you grow up
{Intro}

In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kinda groovy
I call you up and ask you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
At first you say no you've got some plans for tonight
And then you stop and say, "alright"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a fellow looks at you
You'd be sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky!

If you decide someday
To stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying
Just like a ghost
You've been a-haunting my dreams
So I propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy
With a spooky little girl like you
Spooky!
Spooky!
I said  Spooky...

Oh, Raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes

Since my love has left me
I'm so all alone
I would bring her back to me
But I don't know where she's gone
I don't know where she's gone

There must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
Oh, no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry

So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes

Oh, there must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
Oh, no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry

So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes

It keeps on fallin'
Fallin' from my eyes
Wooo, it keeps on fallin' from my eyes
Falling from my eyes
Well no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!

Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

Well no one told me about her
What could I do?
Well no one told me about her
Though they all knew

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!
Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd  acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!

Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there
The screen door slams, christine's (angelina's) dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy orbison singing for the lonely
(hey) that's me (babe) and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone (in that mirror) again tonight
Don't run back inside, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking
That maybe you (we) ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith (well woman) there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but hey (baby, ah) you're alright
And that's alright with me
This 4/4 she's gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl I gotta get her back out on the street
I know you're lonely like me so baby don't try and fake it
I'm no prince and I can't lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and she's pretty tough to beat
There's plenty of room in my front seat, baby if you wanna take it
Oh roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
It's like the rushing touch, the dirty wings them highway angels wear
Well tonight we're gonna find out how it feels
I'm gonna trade in your wings - for wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
Ah, mama, come take my hand (well now try hard chrissie to understand)
We're gonna ride all the way to the promised land
Oh I'm gonna dance all the way, dance all the way
(babe if you're born with nothing in your hands
Hey it's your only chance)
Well I don't know but baby I've been told
There's something waiting for us, down that dirty road
Oh take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
(oh I wish you would come
So leave what you've lost, leave what's grown old on thunder road)
Well now I bought this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
I got my car parked out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
Well I think we could take it all babe, just you and me
Climb in back baby, the ride's for free
Oh come take my hand, we're gonna ride all the way to the promised land
We'll dance all the way
Oh baby I don't know but I've been told
There's something waiting for us, down that dirty road
If we take our chance, take our chance
Now the season's over and I feel it getting cold
I wish I could take you to some sandy beach where we'd never grow old
Ah but baby you know that's just jive
But tonight's bustin' open and I'm alive
Oh do (baby) whay you can to make me feel like a man
But this 4/4/2's gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl, I gotta get her back out on the street
I know you're lonely like me, oh so don't fake it
And maybe I can't lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and she's pretty tough to beat
There's plenty of room in my front seat
Oh if you think you can make it, climb in (so christine climb in)
This is town full of losers and baby I was born to win
He took a hundred pounds of clay
And then He said, "Hey, listen"
"I'm gonna fix this-a world today"
"Because I know what's missin' "
Then He rolled His big sleeves up
And a brand new world began
He created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man
Whoa-oh-oh, yes he did

With just a hundred pounds of clay
He made my life worth livin'
And I will thank Him every day
For every kiss you're givin'
And I'll thank Him every night
For the arms that are holdin' me tight
And He did it all with
Just a hundred pounds of clay
Yes he did, whoa-oh, yes He did

Now can'tcha just see Him a-walkin' 'round and 'round
Pickin' the clay uppa off the ground?
Doin' just what He should do
To make a livin' dream like you
He rolled His big sleeves up
And a brand new world began
He created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man
Whoa-oh-oh, yes he did
With just a hundred pounds of clay

People, let me tall ya what He did
With just a hundred pounds of clay
(You're not a kid anymore
You're not a kid anymore.)
When people ask of me
'What would you like to be now that you're not a kid anymore?'
(You're not a kid anymore.)
I know just what to say
I answer right away
There's just one thing I've been wishing for
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
Each night I sit at home
Hoping that he will phone
But I know Bobby has someone else
(You're not a kid anymore.)
Still in my heart I pray
There soon will come the day
When I will have him all to myself
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
Please release me, let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Release me and let me love again
I have found a new love, dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me, my darling, let me go
(Please release me, let me go)
For I don't love you anymore
(To waste my life would be a sin)
So release me and let me love again
Please release me, can't you see
You'd be a fool to cling to me
To live our lives would bring us pain
So release me and let me love again
(Let me love, let me love)
Sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Honey, ah sugar sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too
(I just can't believe it's true)

Ah sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Ah honey, ah sugar sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
(I know how sweet a kiss can be)
Like the summer sunshine pour your sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)
Sugar, pour a little sugar on it honey
Pour a little sugar on it baby

That fateful night the car was stalled
Upon the railroad track
I pulled you out and we were safe
But you went running back
CHORUS

Clutched in your fingers tight

They buried you today

In the car or walking down the highway
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
When you move up closer to me
I get a feelin' that's ooo-wee (ah)
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
When I feel you put your arms around me
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
When you asked me to meet your ma
I knew that, baby, we'd be going far (ah)
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
All my friends are cryin' out to meet you
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Now's the time to go and see the preacher
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Wedding bells are gonna chime
Baby baby, you're gonna be mine (ah)
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
How gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow?
Birds, high up in the trees
Serenade the clouds with their melodies
Oh, see, there beyond the hill
The bright colors of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us just to fall in love
Now, I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me
Oh, don't ever make me cry
Through long, lonely nights without us
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally
Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Now the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like a wind-blown sand
And a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you, thank you for the gleam that flows its grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you
Sunny, yesterday, oh, my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really, really eased the pain
Now the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you...I love You..
Look over yonder

A new day is coming (whoo-hoo!)
People are changing
Ain't it beautiful? (whoo-hoo!)
Crystal Blue Persuasion

Gonna see the light
Love, love is the answer (whoo-hoo!)

And open your mind


Crystal Blue Persuasion, Mm-hmm

You're my love, you're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
It wasn't on a Sunday (Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)
But I made a promise that you treasured
I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away
Daddy's home to stay
I'm gonna be here come what may
Daddy's home to stay
My tears are fallin'
'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's somethin' that I've got to say

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinkin' of her
In everything you say and do

Oh, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I'd been true
I know she'd never be with you
So, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Well, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Oh, take good care of my baby
Well, take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to end
Don't you know that I danced, I danced till a quarter to three
With the help, last night, of Daddy G
He was swingin on the sax like a nobody could
And I was dancin' all over the room
Oh, don't you know the people were dancin' like they were mad
It was the swingin'est band they had, ever had
It was the swingin'est song that could ever be
It was a night with Daddy G
Let me tell you now
I never had it so good
Yeah and I know you never could
Until you get hip with that jive
And take a band like the Church Street Five
Oh don't you know that I danced
I danced till a quarter to three
With the help last night of Daddy G
Everybody was as happy as they could be
And they were swingin with Daddy G
Blow Daddy!
Let me tell you now

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin' days are GONE
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
SPOKEN
"One more time, everybody, now"
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of my memory, you wander on back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night once again I hold you tight

And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover, we'll always meet

Black is black, I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey, since she went away, oh oh
What can I do, 'cause I, I'm feelin' blue

If I had my way, she'd be here today
But she'd go in time, and leave me to cry again, oh no
What can I do, cause I, I'm feelin' blue
I can't choose, it's too much to lose when our love's too strong
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong
Bad is bad, that I feel so sad
It's time, it's time, that I felt peace of mind, oh oh
What can I do, cause I, I'm feelin' blue
I can't choose, it's too much to lose when our love's too strong
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong

Today is Cindy's birthday
No time for geometry, 'rithmetic, or history
Gotta write a song from my heart, then pick the greatest work of art
Tie them with a ribbon made of gold and give them to Cindy
Today is Cindy's birthday
No time to do the Twist, don't mind all the things I miss
Gotta write a melody, write it from the heart of me
Tie it with a ribbon made of gold and give it to Cindy
Today is Cindy's birthday
Yes, Cindy's happy birthday
FADE
Intro
Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer
Darling I promise you this
I'll send you all my love every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there
I don't want to say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only
Starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running, never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
Oh, I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah!
A you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand
I'll pick up your hand
The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go

So won't you, please
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see
For every kiss you give me, I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you 'til eternity
So won't you, please
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

So c'mon and be
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Oh-oh-oooooh
(Be my, be my baby)
Ooooooooooh
Wha-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Be my, be my baby)
Oh-oh-oooooh
(My one and only baby)
Ooooooooooh
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh
I don't care, about your past
I just want, our love to last
I don't care, darlin', about your faults, ha
I just want to satisfy your pulse
OH!

When you kiss me
When you miss me
Hold my hand
Make me understand
I break out - in a cold sweat
Ho! Uh! Ho!

I don't care, about your wants
I just wanna, ha, tell ya about the do's and don'ts
I don't care about the way you treat me, darlin', ha
I just want, to understand me, honey
OH!

When you kiss me
And ya miss me
You hold me tight
Make everything all right
I break out - in a cold sweat
Maceo, come on now, brother
Put it, put it where it's at now
AHH, let me have it
Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they made
Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block
Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved your my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oooh, babe
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing.  No, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, honey
I got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can see or come to me when I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
Oooh, I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know?
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I play my game of fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together.  (Oh, oooh.)
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there
Oh
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh, Marvin.  (I know, honey.)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (So glad, so glad.)
(Oh, baby.) Ain't nothing like the real thing
Talk to me
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (Oooh.)
(Oh, I'm so glad.) Ain't nothing like the real thing
Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feathered canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From Win and Lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way

I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!

When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick

I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!
Oh my!

At a weekend dance we like to show up last
I play it cool when it's slow and jump it up when it's fast
I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!

Ahhh (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Ahhhh (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
Ahhhhhh, oooh (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance) Dance, (dance) dance
(Dance) Dance, yeah!
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I’ve been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two
They’ll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They’ve got a lot of space
There’ll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you’re never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away
I’ve got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

Oh, L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two
They’ll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I’ve got lots of friends in San Jose
Oh, do you know the way to San Jose?
Hmm, can’t wait to get back to San Jose
Quicksand, quicksand
Pulling me closer, closer in your arms
Can't resist your loving charms
You're like quicksand sinking me deeper in love with you
The more I fight it, the deeper in love I get
Each time you hold me
I feel nothing but happiness
It's not safe loving you this way
But from your arms I can't stay
You're like quicksand, quicksand, yeah
Pulling me closer, closer
Making me love you, need you
Sinking me deeper, deeper in love with you
Deeper, deeper, deeper
In love with you
My heart is a prisoner of your warm embrace
I can't help, I can't help myself
Nothing can take your place
When you say sweet things to me
I start trembling from head to feet
You're like quicksand, quicksand, yeah
Pulling me closer, closer
I just can't resist you
I just want to kiss you
You're like quicksand, yeah
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
Shake!

Selfish one why keep your love to yourself
Oh oh yeah
It's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It seems like you built a fence around your heart and afraid that sharing
Might tear it apart and ya pass up every chance at the start of romance oh
Oh oh oh oh Selfish one why keep your love in store oh oh yeah you think
It's steel that will keep forever more oh oh oh oh oh but steel wears out
Through weather and age and a heart could break down in a lonely stage you
Better let your heart down mate, before it's too late
You let so much time pass by, and I find myself still giving you the eye
Then you must have realized, cause much to my surprise you're making eyes
At me Is it really you?
Now, selfish one you're walking me to my door
Oh oh yeah
Selfish one, you never did this before
Oh oh no
Without a chance to resist, your lips met mine
You begin to let your lovelight shine
And I can see that you're really on the ball, and
You're not selfish at all
No-o-o, not at all
No-o, the way you hold me
Oh oh yeah, the way you squeeze me
No you're not selfish, no no no
You're not selfish at all
Oh oh oh, not at all
No-o the way ya kiss me
Don't ya know that I love the way ya hold me yeah
No-o-o not at all, no-o-o not at all, no-o-o not at all
Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on, moving on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on, moving on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on, moving on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on, moving on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun
You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
Forgive this fool, my darlin'

Oh, this heart of mine
Carries a heavy load
When I think about
How I've hurt you so
After you've been
Been so good to me
I've been unfaithful, darlin'
I've caused you misery
A feeling of guilt
How it tortures me
And only you, my darlin'
Oh, can set me free and

And darlin', all
All I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me, baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand, baby
A moment of weakness, darlin'
Caused me to stray
Your trust in me, dear
I threw away

When I look
Look into your eyes
I can see the hurt, baby
That you feel inside
Although I hurt you, baby
You never once complained
It makes me feel, sweet darlin'
That much more ashamed
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt
Runnin' down my face
Tears that only you, baby
Only you can erase

And darlin', all
All I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me, baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand
Ooh
Forgive this fool, my darlin'

I know I made a big mistake
When all your love, darlin'
Yes, I did forsake
It's on my mind
It's in my heart
This guilty feeling
Tearin' me apart
With every step I make
Every breath I take
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
Undo the wrong I've done
Undo the wrong I've done
I've been unfaithful
I know it's true
But I'll make it up to you, baby

All, all I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand

And the beauty of life can only survive
If we love one another
Oh, yeah, yesterday my friends were marching out to war

Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo- Be-Doo-Da-Day...
If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
Cause that's about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean, vicious woman)
Every day 'for suppertime, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman)
(Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)
Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(Sock a little polk salad to me
You know I need me a mess of it)
Snap your fingers, I'll come runnin'
Back to you-ou on bended knee
Snap your fingers (doo-doo), I'll come runnin' (doo-doo)
I'll be true (doo-doo-doo), take a chance on me (doo-doo-doo)
Let your light turn green, baby, I've gotta know
Give me some kind of clue, should I stay or go?
Let me love you like a lover, un-huh, that you used to know
Turn the key and let me in through that same old door
(Wah-wah-wah-wah)
I had it but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
I know I got to find my way back in
Snap your fingers, baby, I'll come runnin'
I'll do anything to get back again
(Wah-wah-wah-wah)
I had it but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
I've got to find my way back in
Snap your fingers (doo-doo-doo) I'll come runnin' (doo-doo-doo)
I'll do anything (doo-doo-doo) to get back again
So in love, sad as could be
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness
A pretty face may be some guy's taste
But I'll take lovin' in its place

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, oh baby, oh yeah, oh yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, oh yeah
My friends ask what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality
Now show me a girl, a girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' every time

Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I believe that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

So if you're lookin' for a lover (Oh yeah)
Don't judge a book by its cover (Oh yeah)
She may be fine on the outside (Oh yeah)
But so untrue on the inside (Oh yeah)
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell? Whoa oh, oh
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear

I got a date tonight with such a sweet little innocent thing
I'll sweep her off her feet before she knows what's happening
I'm gonna hand her (Ooh!) my sweet-talkin' line
I know it kills her (Wow!) every time
She's gonna love me from the start
And then I'm gonna break her heart

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
This is your conscience speaking

Be kind and sentimental
Treat her tenderly
'Cause if you're not a gentleman
You're gonna hear from me
And if she loves you from the very start
Now listen, Jimmy
I'm tellin' you, you'd better not break her heart
No, no, no, n-no, no, no

Oh, yes, I will
Oh, no, you won't
Yes, I will
No, you won't
Oh, yes, I will, yes, I will, yes, I will
I'm just a big, bad wolf, I know tonight I'll be lookin' so good
She'll be a helpless child just like a Little Red Riding Hood
I'm gonna charm her (Mmm!) right into a trance
I know she'll never (Wow!) stand a chance
She's gonna love me from the start
And then I'm gonna break her heart

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
This is your conscience speaking

Be kind and sentimental
Treat her tenderly
'Cause if you're not a gentleman
You're gonna hear from me
And if she loves you from the very start
Now listen, Jimmy
I'm tellin' you, you'd better not break her heart
No, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, yes, I will
Oh, no, you won't
Yes, I will
No, you won't
Yes, I will, yes, I will, yes, I will
Now listen, Jimmy
You'd better not break her heart
But I'm a lover
You'd better not break her heart
Man, my reputation
You'd better not break her heart
Now, now you listen
You'd better not break her heart
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
I knew a man that I did not care for
And then one day this man gave me a call
We sat and talked about things on our mind
And now this man, he is a friend of mine
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
Don't be afraid of love
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid to love
Listen to me
Everybody needs a little love
Everybody needs somebody
That they can be thinking of
Now, reach out!
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone
Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo
Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone
Alone at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low;
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one;
The trip to heavens begun;
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when were
All alone at last
Oh, my darling, at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low;
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one;
The trip to heavens begun;
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when were
All alone at last
A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail when the tide comes in
I just cast my fate to the wind
I shift my course along the breeze
Won't sail upwind on memories
The empty sky is my best friend
I just cast my fate to the wind
A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail when the tide comes in
I just cast my fate to the wind
Some people call me a teenage idol
Some people say they envy me
I guess they got no way of knowing
How lonesome I can be
I need somebody to be my baby
Someone to tell my troubles to
I got no time to ever find her
'Cause I'm just passing through
I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone
I got no rest when I'm feeling weary
I got to pack my bags and go
I got to be somewhere tomorrow
To smile and do my show
I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone
Some people call me a teenage idol
Some people say they envy me
I guess they got no way of knowing
How lonesome I can be
How lonesome I can be

Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say, it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'

You know

Any smile you might see, baby
Has all been rehearsed

Baby, I can't go on without you
This loneliness won't let me live without you
This emptiness inside me, baby
Makes me feel half alive

Got to have all your lovin'

Got to have all your lovin'

Aww, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl
She fooled me this time
She acted like I was
The last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind
As I took those steps
Toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would
Make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind
Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
But, ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep looking back but
My baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind
Badlees, The The Unfortunate Result Of Spare Time The Unfunny Just be clever for clever s sake, starin  at the ceiling into shadow-fakes The circle-smokes in the ladies room only got you as far as the roles assumed A glimpse of the perfect crime is just a reverie away Whadaya say we hang there a while for expediency s sake? And fantasize the great demise of the unfunny Cut and dry, we ll bid good-bye to the unfunny Their personality inspires like a five pound bag of fertilizer Like living in a house with fifteen cats, you re unaware of the stench when a line goes flat A glimpse of the perfect crime is just a reverie away Whadaya say we hang there a while for expediency s sake? And fantasize the great demise of the unfunny Set  em up, we ll drink a cup to the unfunny 
You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ole rain's fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away

Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day

Yesterday's love was like a warm summer breeze
But, like the weather ya changed
Now things are dreary, baby
And it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' your name

Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day


Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Bring back that sunny day
Oh Stormy
Oh Stormy
Oh Stormy...
(Cowboys to girls)
I remember (I remember)
When I used to play shoot 'em up
(Shoot 'em up, bang, bang, baby)
I remember
When I chased the girls and beat 'em up
But I was young and didn't understand
But now I'm a grownup man
I know girls are made for kissing
Never knew what I was missing
Now my life is not the same
My whole world has been rearranged
I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did (Shoot 'em up, bang, bang)
(Cowboys to girls)
I remember (I remember)
When I used to see you jumping rope
(Jumpin' rope, up and down, baby)
And I remember
When you got your first baby coach
But you were young and didn't understand
Now you're a woman and I'm a man
And it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our lives are not the same
Our whole world has been rearranged
You went from (Baby dolls to boys)
Oh, yes, you did (Jumpin' rope, baby)
And I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did
Now it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our life is not the same
This whole world has been rearranged
I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did (Shoot 'em up, bang, bang)
And you went from (Baby dolls to boys)
Oh, yes, you did (Jumpin' rope, baby)
(Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes (Shoot 'em up)
(Baby dolls to boys)
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
(Cowboys to girls)
She dunno that she's a lucky girl
Got the best thing in the whole wide world
Got a love that's hard to find
But the boy I wish was mine

She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel

He dunno it but she cheats on him
With a boy like that, it's such a sin
I would never be untrue
I would never make him blue


I know there's gonna come a day
He will tell the girl, 'Be on your way,'
Maybe then he'll turn to me
Then how happy I will be that
I realize the way your eyes deceived me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of
Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart
Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
Like your imitation love for me
Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by
Still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (And the world) will be a better place
All the world (And the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (And me)
You just wait (Just wait) and see, wait and see
Take a good look around
And if you're looking down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (And the world) will be a better place
And the world (And the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (And me)
You just wait (Just wait) and see

People now
Put a little love in your heart
Each and every day
Put a little love in your heart
There's no other way
Put a little love in your heart
It's up to you
Put a little love in your heart
C'mon and
Put a little love in your heart
You've got to put a little love in your heart

{Intro}
And if she should tell you "come closer"
And if she tempts you with her charms
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me
And if she should tell you "I love you" (whoa)
And if she tempts you with her charms
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't let her down from your arms)
No no no no no (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me
I know she's the kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now
If she tells you "I love you"
Just remember she said that to me
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no (oh yeah)
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't take her love from my arms)
No no no no no
Don't leave me now for her love belongs to me
{Outro}
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurtin' me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
Rain drops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
The night's the time for all your tears
Your heart may be broken tonight
But tomorrow in the morning light
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
The night-time shadows disappear
And with them go all your tears
For the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy
So don't let the sun catch you cryin'
We know that cryin's not a bad thing
But stop your cryin' when the birds sing
It may be hard to discover
That you've been left for another
But don't forget that love's a game
And it can always come again
Oh don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin', oh no
Oh, oh, oh
We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
