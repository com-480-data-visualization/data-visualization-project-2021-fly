The flowers you gave me are just about to die
When I think about
What could've been
Makes me want to cry
The sweet words you whispered didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold
What could've been on a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere
Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all
At all

How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night
Red roses, temptation
You make the most of a ify situation
I'm weighing my decision
Who's to say if it's love,or if it isn't?
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before, ah
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for
Desire can mean danger
I wanna lover, not another stranger
I'm saving all my passion
Who's to say if its love, or just attraction?
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on, But I want to take it slowly, slowly
And my resistance is weakening,weakening everytime we touch
Baby, you get everything, everything that I've been dreamin' of
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before, oh yeah
Don't rush me. This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah
My resistance is weakening
Every time we touch
Cause baby you've got everything
Everything That I've been dreaming of
(guitar solo)
Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before
Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for
Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before
Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah
Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love
A blue kiss coloring me goodbye
A new kiss could never feel so fine
Tomorrow I'll be livin in black and white
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
Red lips kissin away my fears
A blue kiss bringin me back to tears
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
Yea, these kisses are blue
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
A prism of love surrounded us
Don't you see what our hearts knew
How can you chose a one-color world
When you know that I've got a rainbow for you
Last night a spectrum filled the sky
This morning it shattered with your goodbye
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
Why did it have to be such a blue kiss
Yea, those kisses were blue
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
Don't stop it
Rock it
Don't stop it
Well, I guess it was back in '63
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife
Well, she said she would, so I said, "I do"
But I'da said "I wouldn't" if I'da just knew
How sayin' "I do" was gonna screw up all of my life
Well, the first few years weren't all that bad
I'll never forget the good times we had
'Cause I'm reminded every month
When I send her the child support
Well, it wasn't too long 'til the lust all died
And I'll admit, I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said
"Goodbye, turkey, my attorney will be in touch," mhm
So I decided right then and there
I was gonna do what's right, give 'er her fair share
But brother, I didn't know her share was gonna be that much

She got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it right down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, it all sounds sorta funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft
Now listen, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Why, they give her the color television set
Then they give her the house
The kids and both of the cars
See?
Well, then they start talkin' about child support
Alimony, and the costs to the court
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes
Besides, everything I ever had worth takin' they've already took
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney
Askin' myself, "Why didn't you just learn how to cook?"

They give her the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
They give me the shaft (I got the shaft)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle
But she got the better half
Well, it all sounds mighty funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

Well, she got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it all down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, I guess it all sounds funny (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ha-ha-ha)
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

Heh, heh, they ain't kidding, I got the shaft (Ooh)
But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore (Ooh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I let my wife tote it, I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps (Ooh)
You get it judge?
I'm gonna be indebted (Ooh)
That's not funny, huh?
Huh?
Contempt of court? (Ooh)
What do you mean I'm–
Listen judge, I'm just kiddin' (Ooh)
I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip, can ya? (Ha-ha-ha)
Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Here we are, broken-hearted
We thought our love would never end
We fell hard when we got started
Fallin' out like we fell in

Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Let's don't lie and hurt each other
That would be our worst mistake
Once again let's act like lovers
One more time for old-time's sake
Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory
Let's go out (let's go out)
In a blaze of glory (in a blaze of glory)
All good things must end
Like two heroes (ah) in a story (in a story)
Let's go out (let's go out) like we came in (like we came in)
In a blaze of glory

Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm

So, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off the light

But, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord

'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

Take that look of worry
Mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons
I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen
Oh, but I know who they are

And, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord

Well I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you, but I don't remember

Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember...
As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooh, we got the time
'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I've got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
I found a lover with a slow hand
Ooh, a lover with a slow hand

And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush
Ooh, lover with a slow hand

Far
We've been traveling far
Without a home
But not without a star
Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream
On the boats and on the planes
They're coming to America
Never looking back again
They're coming to America
Home, don't it seem so far away
Oh, we're traveling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and we'll say our grace
Freedom's light burning warm
Freedom's light burning warm
Everywhere around the world
They're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled
They're coming to America
Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
Today, today, today, today, today
My country 'tis of thee
Today
Sweet land of liberty
Today
Of thee I sing
Today
Of thee I sing
Today
I get delirious whenever you're near
Lose all self-control, baby just can't steer
Wheels get locked in place
Stupid look on my face
It comes to making a pass, pretty mama
I just can't win a race

Because I get delirious
Delirious
Delirious

I get delirious when you hold my hand
Body gets so weak I can hardly stand
My temperature's running hot
Baby you got to stop
Because if you don't, I'm going to explode
And girl I got a lot

Because I get delirious, yeah
Delirious
Delirious
I get delirious whenever you're near
Girl you gotta take control because I just can't steer
You're just too much to take
I can't stop, I ain't got no brakes
Girl you got to take me for a little ride up and down
In and out and around your lake

I'm delirious
You, you, you get me delirious
Baby, lay me down
Delirious
The room, the room, the room is spinning around (Delirious)
Yeah, I'm delirious, yeah, oh I'm, oh I'm
Yeah, delirious, yeah (Delirious)
It's got me in repair, everybody you got to (Delirious)
Everybody, oh Lord, oh yeah, I'm delirious (Delirious)

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)

I've seen this world
From corner to corner
There ain't much ground
That I haven't covered
I've drank its wine
I've tasted its pleasures
I've known some love
And I've known some lovers
If there's one lesson
In the livin' I've done
The best things only come
Along in numbers of one
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
I've been a king
And I've been a pauper
And everything there is in between
It took some time
To know what is timeless
But I've found and
Learned what that means
I'll never leave you, girl
'Cause I know the catch
The wonders of this world
Will never come with a match
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
She bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman
This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Lean streaky music
Spawned on the streets
I hear it but with you
I had to go
'Cause my rock 'n' roll
Is putting on weight
And the beat it goes on
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
With you my love
We're going to raid the future
With you my love
We're going to stick up the past
We'll hold today to ransom
'Til our quartz clock stop
Until yesterday
Whoa, until yesterday
Until yesterday
'Til our quartz clock stop
Oh

End of another long show
And I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave
Because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screamed out
"No, just let dreams be your master"
Look past my fame. I'm in need
Need of some laughter

Oh, please let me live in your world
I hope that your eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me
Mmm
Me

So you ask yourself
Oh, this feeling
Is it true from the heart?
Was it my fame and glory?
Why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
And if I want satisfaction
I can have anyone that I see
But why should I settle for less
When I need you
To love me for me
Oh, so confused
Is this real?
Do you love me?
Give me the feeling you care endlessly
My love

Please let me live in your world
(Oh)
I hope that your eyes can see
(Hope that your eyes can see)
That I need someone
(Yeah)
To love me for me
(Mmm, hmm)
Me

Yes, this will be our finest hour
You taught me it was forever
Let's take this to the highest power
Oh, let's take it, baby
Let's take it, baby
Please let me live in your world
(Oh, whoa)
I hope that your eyes can see
(I hope that your eyes see)
That I need someone
(Yeah)
To love me for me
(Tell it to me once more)
That I need someone
(Eee)
To love me
(Who's loving you? Who's loving you, baby?)
Please let me live in your world
Hey, Paul Anthony
Why don't you say something to all the lovers out there?
Well, Bow-Legged Lou
I was just about to ask you to drop the same science
Well, I got a better idea
Hey, Lisa
Why don't you tell it like you feel it?
Well, I would like to say
To all the lovers of the world
If you are in love with someone
I mean really in love with someone
Make sure that you hold on to that person
Make sure that person
Loves you for who you are
And not for the materialistic things that surround you
Enough said
For me
That I need someone
(Yeah, yeah)
To love me for me
They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change
Made them realize, that the promises were lies

The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn
x2
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies

So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn
x2
(yeah)

Oh oh oh
x4
Hush little baby don't cry like that
God's gonna buy you a Cadillac
He's chosen you to do his will
You can spread the word in your coupe de ville
So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And if you still can't see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Look to the heavens and see it shine
Heals the sick and leads the blind
Tune it in and hear it say
It's countin' down to judgment day
So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And if you still can't see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Hey
Hey satellite man your time has come
Your word received by everyone
And should you fall, well that's ok
You love the ones that you betray
So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Yeah when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Hey, hey, hey
Hey God's gonna buy you a satellite
Look to the heavens and see it shine
They say our love was never meant to be
That time would make it just a memory
But they don't know, how can they understand?
We didn't build no castles in the sand
And all the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
Of love, my friend
They say our life was just a fairy tale
No matter how we try, we must surely fail
But where are they now? And could they ever understand?
This ivory tower was built on rock, not sand
And all the king's horses, baby
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
Of love, my friend
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend, yeah
All the king's horses, yeah yeah
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
All (all), all the king's horses
All (all), all the king's men
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm no waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
If you want me, come and say it
Don't wait around for another chance
Make your mind up, make your play
You should be playing to win this time
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
All those wasted years, I didn't know I was only emotion away
I got what I wanted from me, but I didn't see it was not what I needed
I was a fool, this time I'm playing to win
If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm no waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
If you stick with me, baby
I won't do you wrong
And we're gonna have some fun
We're so good together in this crazy world
Where you can't count on anyone
I'd climb any mountain
Just to get you free
I would swim the ocean
Can you do the same for me?
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there
Be there
Ooh
You know that you can lie to me, baby
I will understand
As long as in the end you tell the truth
Cause it's give and it's take
It's no piece of cake and I know it works with you
You don't need no doctor
You don't need no pills
You don't need some cozy friends
Running up your bills
Hey
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there
Bah boom
Bah boom
Bah boom, bah
Bah boom
Bah boom
Bah boom, bah
Hey, hey
Drive my continental
Jam it to the floor
Wear my best clothes out at night
And I'll just give you more
Oh
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there
Oh
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there
Oh
Got no money lying in the bank
Got no banquet on my table
Got no gas in my tank
When my life is laying on the line
And I'm saying my last prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there
How can I get you to notice that I want you?
My heart's on fire with desire
'Cause I love you
There's no time for waiting
Ready
I will tell you
So there's no doubt
I'll spell it out
Come give it to me
Give it

Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me

You've turned the spark of my love
Into a raging flame
And now I need to convince you
To feel the same
So don't you stand there
Talkin' 'bout the way I feel
Cause, baby, talk is cheap
Action speaks louder than words
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me

Hey, babe
My love just won’t let me wait
For you, I’m so weak
You know I’ll do anything it takes
So I beg you please, baby

Come give your love to me (Give it, ooh, ooh)
Come give your love to me (Come give it to me)
Come give your love to me (Give it, ooh)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
(Give it, ooh)
Come give your love to me (Give it to me)
Come give your love to me
Watching my head, holding my face
One more evening gone to waste
No longer do I know my place
Killing time and missing my cues
Watching her belong to you
Tears could only change my view
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x2)
Growing up has always been tough
Good intentions never good enough
I would take you far away
Do anything to make you stay
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x3)
Every drink and ciggarette
All those hands we never met
There are things we should forget
Now its over
Over
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x3)
(music)
Take the L out of lover and it's over (until fade)
I think that it's high time we had a talk
I think that we're making a big mistake
I've been feeling lately the magic is gone
Are we just together for convenience sake, baby
I don't believe it (feeling), I don't think that's true (tied down)
It'll just pass (need to) if we allow it to (break free)
It's just a stage (they say) we're going through (clean cuts)
I think you're just restless (heal much) for something new (faster)
Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return is a peace of each other's time
Are we just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're playing for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation
Don't know if you're right, don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long
Don't make it hard (I won't), don't make it easy (hold you)
We'll just walk away (if you) at the end of the song (must go)
Baby, put one last nickel in the juke box
Give that love we once felt just one final spin around
'Cause we're just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
And we're just dancing
(Solo)
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to each other in desperation
Taxi dancing
Things get bad, times get tough
Everybody knows
You gotta be a little stronger
Just to have the things you need
Everybody knows
If you try a little harder
You're gonna live a whole lot longer
Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour
Going out and stayin' far too long
You got to believe in something
When you believe in something
These are the best of times
You got to have faith in someone
When you have faith in someone
These are the best of times
Don't give up, can't give in
Never lose a minute
It's a long hard road back from nowhere
Love is not what you take out
It's what you put back in it
Take you chance, there's no doubt
Everything will all work out
See my way, I know where I'm goin'
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up
I want it all as soon as I can
Right where I am
You got to believe in something
When you believe in something
These are the best of times
You got to have faith in someone
When you have faith in someone
These are the best of times
The crying parents tell their children
If you survive, don't do as we did
A son exclaims there'll be nothing to do to
Her daughter says she'll be dead with you
While foreign affairs are screwing us rotten
Line morale has hit rock bottom
Dying embers stand forgotten
And talks of peace were being trodden
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Is this the value of our existence?
Should we proclaim with such persistence?
Our destiny relies on conscience
Red or blue, what's the difference?
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
An empty face reflects extinction
Ugly scars divide the nation
Desecrate the population
There will be no exaltation
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
I can´t get off my high horse
And I can´t let you go
You are the one who
You are the one who makes me feel
So real, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, what am I supposed to do
Oh, what am I supposed to do, baby
When I´m so hooked up on you
Then I realize
Oh, I realize
That you are somebody else´s guy
Oh yeah
Why you wanna do this to me boy?
(Somebody else´s guy)

Can you remember the times we spent together
Sharing our days in the sun
Then I found out that you were somebody else´s lover
After all the plans we made, now were shattered

Still I can´t get off my high horse
I can´t let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
Then I realize that you´re somebody else´s guy
That day in September, I´m sure you can remember
That´s when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie and you didn't have an alibi
But baby yet I still cared

You know I loved you so baby that I can´t let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
And realize you´re somebody else´s guy


You know I loved you so baby that I can´t let go l
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
And realize that you´re somebody else´s guy
Under the anvil of the sun
Sweat, like a train
I come, I come
My body to dust
Scorched by the might of the sun
Burning light, burning white heat
Like wildfire
I sweat a fever
My body screams
Disintegrates in the heat
Our love is the FAITH that keeps on burning
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
Burnt at the stake, on a bed of fire
My body rises
Taking me higher
My loves desire
Is pure ascension fire
And love is the FAITH that keeps on burning
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
And then I run 'til the breath tears my throat
'Til the pain hits my side
As if I run fast enough
I can leave all the pain and the sadness behind
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
(I love to feel the rain on my face)
(In the summertime)
Someone just like me
Running into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come
Somehow found my someone

Close to you
That's how I feel
When the world's asleep
And we're sharing sweet
Solitude
Almost gave up
Trying to find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Still can't believe it
What were the odds of

Was that me?
Not long ago
No one here to care
No one's dreams to share
You agree
Nights can be rough
When you can't find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Hard to believe it
What were the odds of


You and me
All alone
That's my favorite time of night
Nothing for us to do
But finding ways to hold each other tight
Imagine
Proud Carry your head so high Feeling kinda of mighty Maybe take a little flight  Proud Who do you think you are Gotta getta grip Or you run out of light  Proud Carry your head so high Feeling kinda of mighty Maybe take a little flight  Proud Who do you think you are Gotta getta grip Or you run out of light  If you feel the urge to groove you better listen When you do experience the strangest feeling You are born to think it s a matter of fact Let your conscience be your guide  Who are you impressing with your lack of virtue Don t you think you ve had to the time to learn the true things You re a bigger fool if you really believe You ll find a diamond in the sky  So proud Carry your head so high Feeling kinda of mighty Maybe take a little flight  Proud Who do you think you are Gotta getta grip Or you run out of light  Open up your eyes and use your inner vision Everybody needs some kind of confirmation So you begin to think a pat on the back Is all you need to get you back  You feed your ego Glorified you, critizied without a reason And you groan and weep And will never cease to have a cautious state of mind  So proud Carry your head so high Feeling kinda of mighty Maybe take a little flight  Proud Who do you think you are Gotta getta grip Or you run out of light  Proud Carry your head so high Feeling kinda of mighty Maybe take a little flight  Proud Who do you think you are Gotta getta grip Or you run out of light  Proud Proud So so so proud

New York
To that tall skyline I come
Flyin' in from London
To your door
New York
Lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark
New York
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
There's a heart
A heart that lives in New York
A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, the love in her eyes
An open door and a friend for the night
New York
You've got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's worth of difference
So here's to you New York
When I look
And my eyes finally meet a lady
Who has something unique
I must know her
Don't stumble on my feet
Get together
At least just enough to speak
To this stranger
If I dream, I'm bound to lose my place
Fascinated, with this beautiful face
Watching her eyes
There focusin' on me
Pay attention, she is talking to me
I'm the stranger
Tryin' to remember that getting it wrong
Is what everyone does
Mutual attraction can be so
Distracting, forget where you were
Strangers can fall in love
When you think about love at all
And you wind up cryin' the blues
And the lonelies person that you know
Is starin' out of the mirror at you you you
Are the stranger
And you know the danger
It'll be right
And you know that she's
With you
She ain't thinkin'
About what she's supposed to do
Worry'in
Might as well just be pretendin'
Hurryin'
When you know every new
Friend is a stranger
I tell ya, I'm alright now
But last week I was in rough shape
But I don't get a break with nothin'!

I played hide and seek when I was three
(No respect, no respect)
Why, they wouldn't even look for me
(No respect, no respect)
I was an ugly kid, I never had fun
(No respect, no respect)
They took me to a dog show and I won!
(No respect, no respect)
When I was born I brought no joy
(No respect, no respect)
My old man said he wanted a boy
(No respect, no respect)
I was an ugly kid, always alone
(No respect, no respect)
Halloween, I had to trick or treat over the phone
(No respect, no respect)

Friends don't call, my phone don't ring
I don't get a break with anything!
(What's the matter, Rodney?)
Ah, death, where is thy sting?!
It's just Rappin' Rodney, ain't wrapped too tight
No, no, Rappin' Rodney, get out of sight
It's just Rappin' Rodney, make no mistake
Poor old Rappin' Rodney, can't get a break!

I'm getting old, it's hard to face
(No respect, no respect)
When during sex I lose my place
(No respect, no respect)
Steak and sex, my favorite pair
(No respect, no respect)
I have 'em both the same way, very rare
(No respect, no respect)
I know I'm old, I could go any minute!
(No respect, no respect)
I got a kidney-shaped pool with a stone in it
(No respect, no respect)
Doctor Vinnie Boombatz, that's another one
(No respect, no respect)
I said I wanna stop aging, he gave me a gun!
(No respect, no respect)

I told him I got water on the knee
He gave me a sponge and raised his fee!
(What's the matter, Rodney?)
Ah, it ain't easy bein' me
It's just Rappin' Rodney, ain't wrapped too tight
No, no, Rappin' Rodney, get out of sight
It's just Rappin' Rodney, make no mistake
Poor old Rappin' Rodney, can't get a break!

Now, gimme a break! Play something from the 40s!
Now, what kinda music is this? How about "Stardust"?
Man, what are you doin'?! That's not "Stardust"!
Listen to this, will ya? I mean, where are the flutes?
What a band... ey, don't quit your day jobs
Look at this, the drummer carries the melody!
Hey, tell the bass player I like his instrument
Hey boys, keep it going! Lay it on me, I'm in the groove!

Nothing goes right, I just can't fight it
(No respect, no respect)
Well, Eastern Airlines thanked me for flying United!
(No respect, no respect)
I got some money, what did I do?
(No respect, no respect)
I bought some quicksand, the deal fell through!
(No respect, no respect)
My car broke down, I called Triple A
(No respect, no respect)
They left the car and towed me away!
(No respect, no respect)
I can't take it no more, I'm getting too old
(No respect, no respect)
I called Suicide Prevention, they put me on hold!
(No respect, no respect)
Winter, summer, spring, and fall
I'm always up against the wall!
(What's the matter, Rodney?)
Ah, I don't get no respect at all

It's just Rappin' Rodney, ain't wrapped too tight
No, no, Rappin' Rodney, get out of sight
It's just Rappin' Rodney, make no mistake
Poor old Rappin' Rodney, can't get a break!

It's getting worse, it's caving in!
The heaviness, I can't take it no more
It's all over... hey, where are my kids?
Somebody help me! Hey, bartender!
Hey, who's that guy with my daughter?
Where's my wallet? How do I get outta here?
Stop that dancing...!
Gypsy, sittin' looking pretty
A broken rose with laughin' eyes
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin', searchin' for a feeling
But it's easy come and easy go
Oh I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best if me, oh can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see?
You're such a secret, misty eyed and shady
Lady how you hold the key
Oh you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see, just tryin' to say to you
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me, oh can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see, Can't you see
No! No! No!
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringinn' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak

I don't know what your folks got against me, girl
But I do know that I want you permanently in my world
What's age or color or money when you love one another?
I know you keep saying to me, 'Our love will win and then you'll see.'

But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day
So you and I can be free, oh baby
To share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives making love
Morning, noon, and night

Take the wings from a bird and don't you know it can't fly
If they take your love from me, I will surely die
Don't get lost in all they're saying
Games are all that they're playing
I know you keep saying to me, 'Our Love will win and then you'll see.'

But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day, girl
So you and I can be free, oh baby
To share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives making love
Morning, noon, and night, baby
Yeah, baby
True love is a once in a lifetime thing, my dear
We can't let what others think about us destroy what we share
You said 'We can take the rejection
We can build a wall of protection.'
I can feel the pressure closing in all around us
Girl, don't let them destroy our love

But baby, sail away with me
Where you, girl, and I can be free
We're gonna share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives
Making love morning, noon and night
Baby, sail away with me
Where you and I can be free
Girl, we're gonna share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives
Making love morning, noon and night
Baby, sail away with me
Where you and I can be free
Can't wait another day
We're gonna share our love under the stars above
The following is a PSA about— (El Scorch Shot)
What? No, no, no, it's not about the— (Ay carumba!)
Listen, it's not about the Scorch Shot (El Scorch Shot?)
No, no, no, it's about the flamethrower's airblast (El Scorch Shot?)
You know what? Forget it (Scorch Shot)

Goddamn you halfway-asleep Pyros
Do it to me every time
Oh, the med is dead and I am burning
It's concering, I'd say
But you walk past without extinguishing
Health is diminishing, it's gonna finish me
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
All you had have to do is come right-click me

We're on the same team, so please
Come and help me, I'm dying, oh
How have you not figured out
That airblast is a thing?

I asked you to go to the Weezer concert
You said you never heard of them (how dare you)
How cool is that? (not at all!)
So I spectated you and looked you're wearing:
Purple paint-painted gibus with a couple of stranges
And then my heart stopped:
Flamethrower with a strange part
Allies extinguished? Where do I start!
We're on the same team, so please
Come and help me, I'm dying, oh
How have you not figured out
That airblast is a thing?

How stupid is it?
I have to beg you for it
I don't have a sandwich
And there's not a single health pack
How stupid is it?
Did the game teach you this?
Just come up to me and say goodbye to my health
How stupid is it?
For all I know you're trying to
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe your mouse does not have an M2


I wish I could get my health out of the red
Cause I think we'd make a good team
And we could rock out to Bloody Stream
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
Cause I'm low and I'm about to die
It's so dire, so meet me at spire
I'll kill all the Spies if you kill all the fire
We're on the same team, so please
Come and help me, I'm dying, whoa
How have you not figured out
That airblast is a thing?

I'm burning alive (I'm burning alive)
I'm burning alive
And I'm dying
How have you not figured
That airblast is a thing?
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl

The things you say tear me apart
You know you get your way with my heart
I'm just a little girl in the dark
The things you say tear me apart
You know you get your way with my heart

I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl

How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today


I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tеll me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to lеave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)
Well I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't want to hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more
No more
I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more
All I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing
Hey, livin' with you
Is all I wanted before
I've changed, you didn't
Don't wanna see you no more
All I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Oh, stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing
Well we were walkin' before we could crawl
And you were lovin' just emotion just all
It's just emotion wasn't music at all
Now I can't stop the music
Now I don't wanna hear it no more
No more, no more, no more
Stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing
I can't stop the music (stop this game)
I could stop it before (it's gonna really end)
Now I don't wanna hear it (stop this game)
Don't wanna hear it no more (it's such a touchy, touchy thing)
If you want to hang on to my shoulder
I'm standing here
If you want to do it all over
Let me get near
If you were another pretender
Oh I'd pass you by
If you were a lost weekender
Oh maybe I'd try
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna show me what it's like
If you want to talk about it
I got the time
When you're looking so enchanted
You cover my mind
If you think I'll wait forever
Oh maybe you're right
There's no such thing as now or never
There's only twilight
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
Oh give me something to grab for
When you gonna show me
Show me what it's like
If you want to think it over
Oh I'll just wait around
If you want to take me over
I won't turn you down
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
C'mon and give me something to grab for
You gotta show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
When you gonna give me something to grab for
You gotta put it in my sight
Oh give me something to grab for
You gotta show me what it's like
Give me something to grab for
Show me what it's like
You gotta give me something to grab for
Oh give me something to grab for
Show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
Here by my side
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less
Do you know
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
Out in a world of tears we
We were hanging on
We come together
We find the sun
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
Promises to be there
Life, where the few may not ever find a heaven

We got each other my love
My life, my friend
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away

Promises...aaaah!
Well, I know where you're goin'
I see where you've been
Don't you know by now, you never take life on the chin
Still you sit and wonder why the past is gone
Baby, you'll go under if you don't carry on
Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you
Just you
I don't need no promises, just tell me the truth
Mister, keep it honest, that's all I ask of you
Don't be second-guessin', 'bout where you want to be
Baby, count your blessings 'cause you won't find one like me
Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you
Well now, lady, get your dress on, grab them fancy shoes
Honey, I'm ready and waiting on you
Time is surely wastin', we've so much to do
We're both too smart to be fakin'
And I know it doesn't matter which road we take
Or if it's your way or my way
Well, lady, let me tell you what we're gonna do
Uh huh
We're gonna ride every highway
Don't misunderstand me
Bet I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you
To find you
To find you
To find you
To find you
To find you
I told you once I'm a jealous man
But you never want to listen to who I am
We're divided, completely out of touch
I guess that's why we seem to fight so much

Believe me, darling, this ain't no game
If you think I'll be your fool, you better think again
I know you love me, but it just ain't right
I'm sick and tired of fighting with you every night

You say you don't wanna hurt me
But you're doing things I can't explain
Oh baby, why don't you leave me?
'Cause you know I'll never change

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
But one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
I'll find a honey to take a chance
And roll that dice into my past
She'll cover me for a little while
And show me love ain't out of style

I don't care how long it takes
My heart's in the hands of fate
Oh God I ain't asking much
Just a woman that I can trust

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
Oh but one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I wanna love that's strong and real
I gotta know just how it feels
Somebody to share my life
To hold onto through the night
It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I may get used to
Dragging my heart around
I lay here beside you, just thinkin' all night
I believe that tomorrow would make things all right
I still tell you I love you, that you're forever mine
It makes you feel good and it buys me some time
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day
I never questioned my feelings before
I felt but I felt there was it, nothin' more
But I can't keep denying the truth in my heart
Ooh, the touching and talking but we're oceans apart
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day
I've been spending my life
Thinking you're the one
Now I'm holding my lies
And the damage was done
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love...
I've been calling it love...
People talking
And they're saying that you're leaving
You're so unhappy
With the way that you've been living

Oh-oh-oh, we always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change (change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change

Look in the mirror
And you see how you've been taken
Ooh, you won't surrender
And now your heart is breakin'

Oh-oh-oh, we always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change (change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change
Do you remember
When you got your lucky break?
You're looking back now
And it seems like a mistake

Oh-oh-oh, we always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change (change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change

It's only change (change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same (change)
What's in your heart will stay the same
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same (what's in your heart)
It's only, it's only, it's only change
Never (it doesn't matter)
You ain't gonna, you ain't gonna change (what's in your heart)
When you asked how I've been here without you
I like to say "I've been fine" and I do
But we both know the truth is hard to come by
And if I told the truth, that's not quite true

Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone

Now the face that I see in my mirror
More and more is a stranger to me
More and more I can see there's a danger
In becoming what I never thought I'd be

Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you?
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true
Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
(I see you across the street)
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one
Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you
Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
If you love me
(You will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry
(That day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me
Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
Baby stop
Ooh you'd better stop
Ooh stop
Baby stop
Baby stop
You'd better stop
Stop, stop stop
Stop
You'd better stop

All fall down
I used to wake up at night
Feelin' so lonely
Before I knew you really loved me
I used to cry in my sleep
With tears on my pillow
I didn't think you wanted to know
But now you've change my world
I'm wondering how to keep myself from falling over
You're a special boy, my baby
And when you touch me
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home
I used to be so unsure
Afraid I'd discover
You want a friend but not a lover
But there's no fear in my mind
'Cause now we're together
Our love keeps growing bigger, be sure
I could jump for joy, you sweet thing
See me walk on air when people staring
They're looking at our mystery
And when, when you smile we
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I'll follow
'Cause you can lead me home
You're makin' me dance, make me sing
Anything, as long as you are here with me
I've found I can't touch the ground
You know you've made my inhibitions
(All fall down)
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I'll follow
Two hearts together
We're a harmony so right
Two sparks united
We're a fire burning bright
For that you're always brand new
Right from the jump we had a hunch
That we had everything
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Together
So deep
Inside we share a feeling that's so rare
So sweet
Just knowing that we are a special pair
We're right on time
We're two of a kind
And heaven knows this love will grow
Stronger every day
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
Perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Together
We can conquer any mountain
(Oh, baby)
Just as long as we're together

Overflowing with love

Perfect combination
Lovers you and me

We couldn't ask for any better
I'm trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
The best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it, I'm crawling on your shore

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Closer I am to fine, yeah

I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper
And I was free
And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Closer I am to fine, yeah

I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
When I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain
Yeah, we go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival, and we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Woo

If you don't know how I feel for you
It's time
I let all feelings show
I love you
And I'll never let you go
No, baby
Right now we're just friends
But I pray someday
You'll surrender to love so tender
I won't push you
As long as you know that my love is true

Get closer to you, baby
Hey
Closer than just friends
I want to
Get closer to you, baby
Hey
Closer than just friends
How about you?
How about you?

It's hard to explain
When you're close to me
I get a warm sensation inside
I can't deny this
I want to try it
Each and every time you come by
Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table
You know I'm thankful
For what we have
But I have feelings inside
They're so strong
I can't hide

How about you?

I know you're probably thinking
That you heard this so many times before
But, girl
When you're here
I want you to stay
And when you're gone
I want you even more every day

Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table
You know I'm thankful
For what we have
But I have feelings inside
They're so strong
I can't hide

Get closer to you, baby
(How about you?)
Hey
My baby
My baby
Whoa, whoa

Hey, yeah
Closer than friends
Me and you
Woo

Whoa, oh
Nothing I won't do
To get close to you
Baby, yeah

Am I black or white? Am I straight or gay? (Controversy)
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? (Controversy)
Controversy (Controversy)
I can't understand human curiosity (Controversy)
Was it good for you? Was I what you wanted me to be? (Controversy)
Do you get high? Does your daddy cry? (Controversy)
Controversy (Controversy)

Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me?
Some people wanna die so they can be free
(I said) life is just a game, we're all just the same...(Do you wanna play?)
Controversy, controversy, controversy
Controversy, controversy, controversy

Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever

You're so square--baby
You're so square . . 
Oh, you don't like greasy diners
You don't like sleazy bands
You just want to go
To a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care
You don't like going to parties
To toot and talk all night long
You just want to park
Where it's nice and dark
And kiss me, sweet and strong
You're so square
Baby I don't care
You don't know any dance steps
That are new
But nobody else can love me
Like you do
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Darlin' I don't care
Oh, I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
I don't care
You're so square
Somewhere...
Hey girl. help me if you can
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand
Give me love, I'm starved for affection
All I need is just a little direction
Wow
Somewhere in America
Somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America
She waits for me
I need a teacher who can use a pet
Give me a lesson in etiquette
If there is anyone who'd like to try
Maybe she'd like to come and teach me tonight
Wow
Somewhere in America
Somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America
She waits for me
Same old story, same old song and dance
What good is the glory, if you can't find romance
I know she is waiting
Ooh, somewhere in the heartland
And if she's out there tonight
I wish she would raise her hand
Hey girl. help me if you can
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand
Give me love, I'm starved for affection
All I need is just a little direction
Wow
Somewhere in America
Somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America
She waits for me
Somewhere in America....
Miracle of miracles
Look what the night dragged in
It's a pocket full of misery
And trouble on the wind

You spoiled the best years of your life
You took them all in vain
Now you think that you're forgiven
But you can't be born again

And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why

I don't love you anymore
I don't think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid

Promises, sweet promises
You kept them from your mind
Like all the lost forgotten things
You never seemed to find
Like all the disappointments
You displayed upon your shelf
Now you've got no-one to turn to
You've got no-one but yourself

And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why

I don't love you anymore
I don't think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid

You spoiled the best years of your life
You took them all in vain
Now you think that you're forgiven
But you can't be born again
(2x)
And you say, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

(2x)
And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why
On my back
You're on my track
I can feel you creeping up on me
Such a hungry love on the hunt
Stalking through the night
We're running wild
In your eyes I'm the prize
In the lion's den I can't get free
Now we're alone
Don't let me go
'Cause you're bringing out the savage beast in me
My scent's in the air
It's everywhere
I'm gonna be your prey tonight
I've given up the chase
I'm ready to be tamed
So tonight you better use your
Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight
Animal instinct - come to me
I wanna be your primitive lover
Set a trap
Then you attack
Bringing me to life with every bite
A single touch is just enough to stir the animal inside of me
Lost in your jungle
Weak from the heat
I'm gonna be your prey tonig
I won't hide anymore
Listen for the roar
I know tonight you're gonna use your
Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight...
A savage heart
Hungry for the touch
In the dark I'm ready for the hur
I hear the call
The call of the wild
Every night I need to feel your
Animal instinct -
Oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight...
My scent's in the air
It's everywhere...
Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight...
Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight...

Ruby said that you were on your way
Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way
Well when they say you've lost your touch I smiled
They couldn't handle anything you're laying down
It's a fact you put the "snap" in crocodile
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
My aftershave has given my hiding place away
Stiletto heels a split skirt, you're a dream
But when you locked that bedroom door I screamed
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
Ruby said that you were on your way
Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
Woo woo

Dear mommy, dear daddy
You had plans for me, oh yeah
I was your only son
And long before this baby boy
Could count to three
You knew just what he would become
Run along to school
No child of mine grows up a fool
Run along to school
When you tried to tell me what to do
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure

Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Dear mommy, dear daddy
Now I’m 19, as you see
I'm handsome, tall and strong
So what the hell gives you the right
To look at me as if to say “Hell, what went wrong?”
Where were you last night?
You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night?
Well I think that you may just be right
But don’t try to keep me in tonight
Because I’m big enough to break down the door
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Boys like you are bad through and through
Still, girls like me
Always seem to be with you
We can’t help but worry
(You’re in such a hurry)
Mixing with the wrong boys
(Playing with the wrong toys)
Easy girls (And late nights)
Cigarettes (And love bites)
Why do you have to be so cruel?
You’re such a fool

Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I just can't help thinking
What you've done to me (done to me, done to me, done to me)
You built a wall of love
And tore it right down in front of me
And you think you know
What's going on
You keep telling me that I am wrong
I don't care about
What you do
'Cause if you mess with me
I'll get rid of you

The picture you see
Is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown
To someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild
It makes me act like a child

You think I am crazy
But what can I do? (I do, I do, I do)
You waste your time, like my money
It ain't so funny, but it's true
(Don't waste my money, baby)
Now, you can't tell me
What's going on
And that I am weak
While you are strong
What is it you need
That makes your heart bleed?
Do you really know?
'Cause it doesn't show
The picture you see
Is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown
To someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild
It makes me act like a child


The picture you see
Is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown
To someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild
It makes me act like a child
Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry
Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt, they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and starts to cough
Just like the old man in that
Famous book by Nabokov

Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me
Silver moon
Shining on my bed
Beside my pillow
Light the pathway
To bring that man
To me

Oh, ooh
Something tells me
My words are going straight to his heart
And ooh, something tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me

Know a secret
How to make you want me
How to make you love me
Whoa, oh...
'Cause the moon above
It's a friend of mine
And she'll make you burn
Said, ooh, ooh
Something tells me
The fire's going right up your spine
Whoa, ooh, something tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you, yeah
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me
Whoa, oh, yeah

Come on, baby
You know what I want
That's it
Come a little closer, baby
Yeah

Oh, oh, oh
Something's telling me, yeah
Fire's going right up your spine
And ooh, ooh, something's tells me, yeah
You will be all mine
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, yeah
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you (Sweet baby)
Ooh, baby, I need you (Said I need you)
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Come on home to me, baby)

Sweet baby, I love you (Oh)
Oh, baby, I need you
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Baby, why don't you come on home to me)
Baby, come to me

Baby, come to me (Oh)
Sweet baby, I love you
Oh, baby, I need you
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Oh, baby, come to me)
Baby, come to me
I gave my love, I gave my life, I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable
I guess I gave you all of my time
And now you plead insanity and you don't even know the score
Why can't you learn to play the game?
Baby, don't you know that you need me more? (More, more, more)

You need another lover like you need a hole in your head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah

We were brothers and sisters
United all for love
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
You try to fight it (try to fight it)
You say you've had enough (say you've had enough)
Even though we had big fun (even though we had big fun)
You want another someone (You want another someone)
Your happily ever after be (Sure as there's a sun)
Sure as there's a sun, (I'm going to be the one)
I'm going to be the one and if (you don't understand)
You don't understand face to face (face to face)
Baby I'll tell you down on my knee, yeah
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah
You need another lover
You know there ain't no other
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head
(hole in your head, hole in your head)
You need another lover like you need a hole, hole, hole, hole, ah

You need another lover
You know there ain't no other
There's going to be a riot, if you don't clap your hands
If you don't make that funky stand, everybody
You know there ain't no other
You're doing it every night, you play with my emotions
Before we go on fighting let's get one thing straight
Is it going to be him or me--You know I need an answer
And now down to the wire and I just won't wait
There's something going on, I want to hear it from you face-to-face
Ya--you know it won't be long, before you make your last mistake
Cause you're dangerous, you've got it coming to you
Dangerous--Now what am I going to do?
Dangerous--And I'm a lot like you
We got to talk it out, there's three sides to every story
Well--ya, there's your side, there's my side and then there's the truth
I want to hear it from you, ya say we're all the same
But I know you ain't no angel
Cause who you gonna blame when you wake up
Beside a stranger
Dangerous--You got it coming to you
Dangerous--Now what am I going to do, Baby
Dangerous--And I'm a lot like you
I'm a lot like you
There's something going on, I want to hear it from you face-to-face
Ya--you know it won't be long, before you make your last mistake
Cause you're dangerous, you've got it coming to you
Dangerous--Now what am I going to do?
Dangerous--And I'm a lot like you

What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
All in tatters
What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
The fire down below
That really matters
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here
All I want is you
I don't want a man who says
Good morning, dear, no, no
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
Nobody else but you
Let 'em listen at the door
Let 'em listen through the floor
Let 'em go ahead and draw
The wrong conclusion
So chase me 'round the room
Make me crazy like the moon
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
(We share, yeah)
All I want is you
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
No, I don't
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
Nobody else, no one but you
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
(All I want is you)
And the sexy hurricane that we share
All I want is you
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
He's gonna fall
All I want is you
And your freight train
Whistling over my track, oh, oh
All I want is you
And your Mack truck loving
Jumping me, Jack
Oh, Jack
All I want is you....

I know
I'm mostly out here by myself
Doing exactly what I like
I know I'm easy to please
Out of sight out of mind
You know
I think about you all the time
When I'm walking these streets
But then I go 'round the corner
And I follow my feet

I, me, mine, I me mine
I don't have the time
I, me, mine
I can't get in line
I me, mine, I, me mine
I can't choose
Neither here not there
I, me, mine
Then there's you

You know I'm loving every minute of it
Crazy as it may seem
I have been cutting the ropes
Now I'm floating downstream
I know you watch me when I disappear
Into a world of my own
But when I'm out there
U can't wait to get home
Yeah

I, me, mine, I me mine
I don't have the time
I, me, mine
I can't get in line
I me, mine, I, me mine
I can't choose
Neither here not there
I, me, mine
Then there's you
(x2)

Uptown, Downtown
Get out of town
This is my town
Upstream, Downstream
This is my dream
But I want you in
I know I'm mostly out here by myself
Doing exactly what I like
I know I'm easy to please
Out of sight out of mind

I, me, mine, I me mine
I don't have the time
I, me, mine
I can't get in line
I me, mine, I, me mine
I can't choose
Neither here not there
I, me, mine
Then there's you
(x2)
If I could ever say it right
And reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor
Then you might
Come to believe in me
The life I lead is not the kind
That gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find
That you can believe in me
Those other loves that
Came before
Mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure
And will not believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real
If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real
If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Makes you believe in me
Oh, you can believe in me
Alright
It's hard getting through to me
I'm truly elusive
I got my own point of view
I am the one of a kind
And I tell you l'il girl
I'm fascinated by you
There's something about you
That makes all the difference
Like the night is to day
Well I can get along without you
But I know that within you
You've got what I'm missing
And I'll find a way
To get reaction to action
Hey, say the word that would thrill me
Yeah, I need reaction to action
Just one look that would kill me
You got a way of drawing attention to you
You know you stand out in a crowd
But the way that you play
With any man's affections
Should never be allowed
See I consider myself
The one who will show you
I'd go as far as to say
Girl, I ain't leaving here without you
But you better understand
There's only one rule in this game we're going to play
And that's reaction to action
Maybe like a word that would thrill me
I need reaction to action
One look that would kill me
Give me reaction to action
It's getting late I'd better make a definite move
Reaction to action
And after that baby, it's up to you
I need reaction to action
Just a word that would thrill me
I need reaction to action
You know what I'm talking about
Give me some reaction to action
You got a look, you got a way that'll kill me
Reaction to action, reaction to action, action
Baby, don't think about it, just react
Reaction to action
Knock, knock it out the box, Bronson
Knock, knock it out the box, Bronson
Yeah, uh, knock, knock it out the box, Bronson

Bitch I'm a superhero, I wasn't born with dinero
Somehow I turned into Deniro
Just give me one shot at the lead role
You'll be amazed, like the first time you seen snow
Down in Georgia on the Peach Grove
I shoot ninety-five percent from the free throw
Sixty from the field, strange sex appeal
The lone gunman, muffle the shotty with an old onion
This is no fun, never low funds, man, fuckin' crazy, uh
You must be out your mind
Back with a vengeance
Black MAC lookin' like Janet with extensions
I'm back on the bench presses, put the Audi in a red dress
Make ten lefts, I lost fifty on the Mets, I'm a mess
After practice hit the steps bitch
That's what I gotta do to be the best shit
Man these motherfuckers sleepin'
While Bronson bangin' pots and pans
Gotta understand these fake fucks are not your mans
Me, disappear, where? I'm right here
Creepin' in the cold nights air
To get on my level take fifty light-years
My jewelry boxes like the habitat for white bears
After I'm finished in the sauna
I jump into some freezing cold water
Shake it like I'm reading from the Torah
I'm 'bout to tat a skull on my skull
Hangin' from a snake's mouth comin' out a pyramid
Now I'm at the steakhouse gettin' dirty looks
Guess I shoulda wore a different shirt
Poppin' wheelies on the Harley down 53rd
Break the guitar on your head after my solo shit
I coulda been in Guns N' Roses dolo, bitch
Got the Box Chevy jumpin' like a pogo stick
Don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo kid? Uh
Yeah, don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo
Like Jerry West and Teddy Ballgame
I don't wear Balmain, swing the ball and chain executioner style
Dirty mountain tiger to the face
Better strap up, I'm 'bout to see space
As I entered, I felt everything was centered
Oh shit, I think I'm back in the placenta
But then I woke up in a Nissan Sentra
In the parking lot of Queens Center, uh (Don't hurt me baby)
My grandparents learned English watchin' Martin, uh, ha yeah
My grandparents learned English watchin' Martin, it's me, uh
Wild immigrants, my grandparents learned English watchin' Martin
Knock, knock, knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Knock, knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Knock, knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Yeah, uh, it's me, motherfucker

(*Laughing*)
That's a ill vision
(*Laughing*)
That's pretty fucked up
(*Laughing*)
It sounds so bad, like the dog pound is runnin' through his bitch
(He's walkin')
They all had their sneakers on, fuckin' fakin'
(*Laughing*)
Sometimes I sit and I dream on for hours
Sometimes my hours they turn into days
I dream of a girl I once knew as a schoolboy
She was the one who could sing me away
But she is a long ways away
And I want to be with her today
I'll think of a way I can get back
Oh I'd run all the way back home
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
What do you see when you look in the mirror
I see a face from the past it's so clear
What do you hear when I sing you forever
A song that will last for a million years
But I am a long ways away
I want to be with you today
Think of a way I can get back
Oh I'll run all the way back home
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
Just when we think we conquered it
It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us
That get harder and harder and harder
And harder and harder to remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Let's not pretend that we're unique
'Cause everybody's tasted loves illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the chaos and confusion
And the love we feel
Is gettin' deeper and deeper and deeper
And deeper, and deeper by the minute
But we let it slip away
'Cause we don't know a good thing while we're in it
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
"Y el amor que sentimos es mas profundo" ("The love that we feel is deeper")
Here we are
Back in love again this time unlike before
You and I
Giving so much more
Learning what it really means to love someone
To trust in love
Sharing life as one
In a special way
Time be still
Listen to my heart it?s beating strong and clear
And so fast
Yes, it's love, you know
Filling empty days that now seem so long ago
We found love
Trusting in each other
In a special way
 Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way
I know miracles do come true
The moment I laid my eyes on you
 That love has shown us that special way
To love, to hold each other in a special way

To love, to hold each other
Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way
Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way
Oh
Yes, I want to love you more and more each day
In a special way
I work my fingers
To the bone for you
What do I get in return
And when I think
About the things you do
You know I go into a slow burn
I ain't trying to run your life
All I want is you to realize
All I'm asking
Darling, Danielle, don't
Oh, no, Danielle, don't, oh, no
I know temptation
Gets the best of you
You may invite it
I don't know
Everyone needs a little excitement
I know that's true
Just how far will you go
Think twice
You know it's a mistake
Take my advice
Before it's too late
All I'm asking
Darling, Danielle, don't
Oh, no, Danielle, don't
No, no, no, no, Danielle, don't
Girl, don't do it
Girl, don't do it
No, no, no, no
Remember the good times
The fun we had
When you were my lover
Was that so bad
Honey, you don't need a lover
You need an audience
Well, this show is over
This is how it all ends
Wow, don't, don't
Don't do it, baby
No, no, no, no
Girl, I'm begging
Yes, I'm begging on my knees....
They hung a sign out, sign out after seven
Down at the hive where you're such a busy bee
So sign in honey, sign up for heaven
Just you tonight, it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
There'll be a high time, high time at the lakeside
Barry and the boys are going in for free
We'll jump the moon, take it for a joyride
I stuck it up there for you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
I'm just a bluebird, bluebird at your window
And it's for sure, you're a pretty sight to see
But life's so short and I know what you're into
Come it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
I was sitting all alone, watching people getting off, with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
There is a time when a man needs someone to talk to
Someone to talk to, somebody who'll always be there
All alone, nothing seemed to matter
So alone, doesn't get much better
Can't explain something that you're feeling
For the very first time

There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere
All alone, suddenly you see her
So alone, you know you're gonna need her
Can't explain something that you're feeling
For the very first time

Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right

There was a time when you needed someone to count on
You needed someone to count on
Someone to care
Now she's here, nothing seems to matter
She's so near, everything is better
Can't explain, something that you're feeling
For the very first time
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the air that you're breathing tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right


Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the air that you're breathing tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around
Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone


It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or a fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you gave up and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
Well, I could tell you "goodbye" or maybe "see you around"
With just a touch of a sarcastic "thanks"
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
I've been whispering softly trying to build a cry up into a scream
We let the past slip away and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed-out dream
And I've been dreaming forever, hoping something would eventually come
I saw your eyes in the dark, I felt your kiss on my lips
I traced your body in the air until the bodies were numb
Well, I could tell you "goodbye" or maybe "see you around"
With just a touch of a sarcastic "thanks"
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's fine
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
Oh, it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
Oh, it's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
(Read 'em and weep) For all the hours we'll be spending alone
(Read 'em and weep) For the dreams we'll ignore
(Running silent and deep) And all those promises we promised to keep
They won't be kept anymore
(Read 'em and weep) For the magic that our bodies had made
(Read 'em and weep) For the blood that we've lost
(Running silent and deep) And all those secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost
(Read 'em and weep) For the memories still alive in the bed
(Read 'em and weep) For the lies we believed
(Running silent and deep) And all the things that will have never been said
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
Come on and look at me and read 'em
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's there in my eyes, it's all I can say
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
No more runnin' down the wrong road
Dancin' to a diff'rent drum
Can't you see what's goin' on
Deep inside your heart
Always searchin' for the real thing
Livin' like it's far away
Just leave all the madness in yesterday
You're holdin' the key
When you believe it
Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive on and on
We'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Smilin' with the risin' sun
Livin' like we've never done
Goin' all the way
Reachin' out to meet the changes
Touchin' every shining star
The light of tomorrow is right where we are
There's no turnin' back
From what I'm feeling
Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive on and on
'Cause there'll be starlight all night
When we're close together
Share those feelings dancin' in your eyes tonight
They're guiding us
Shinin' till the mornin' light
Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive on and on
All the waiters in your grand café
Leave their tables when you blink
Ohh, every dog must have his every day
Every drunk must have his drink

Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

All your life you had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet
Ohh, all your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete

Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

Mmm, you can say the human heart
Is only make-believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire
All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street

Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you, "Parlez-vous français ?"

Don't look for answers
You took your chances
Don't ask me why

Don't ask me why
Seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I missed you (I missed you, too)

'Cause you, you and I-I-I back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I-I-I back together again
Got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
And I'm in here heart in hand
You take all that I got and you need it, baby

'Cause you, you and I-I-I back together
Got the world in a spin
You, you and I-I-I back together
Got the world in a spin

Love will last forever (Forever)
We can make it real (Got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never (No, no, never)
We can truly feel (What you feel)
I feel like you
Back together
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle
To stay (Baby)

'Cause you, you and I-I-I back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I-I-I back together again
Got the world in a spin

Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
It's so easy to do when you care

Love will last forever (Forever)
We can make it real (Got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never (No, no, never)
We can truly feel (What you feel)
I feel like you
Back together
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Back together again
Doo doo doo doo doo

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Back together again

Back together again
