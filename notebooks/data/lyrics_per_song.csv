Eastside,"benny blanco, halsey ",2019,2010,"Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set"
Wait For You,elliott yamin,2007,2000,"I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside
This is not how you want it to be

Baby, I will wait for you
Baby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do

Baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting"
Wildflower,skylark,1973,1970,"She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears still rings in midnight silence in her ears
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
And if by chance I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
But if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden to be mine
Be careful how you touch her, for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows that only she can hear
And so she goes
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
Let her cry for she's lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild
She's free"
Even Though I'm Leaving,luke combs,2019,2010,"Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere"
Do Re Mi,blackbear,2017,2010,"Do, re, mi, fa, so

Yeah, if I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed

If I could go back to the day we met

You Make It Easy,jason aldean,2018,2010,"Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be

Smack That,akon ,2006,2000,"Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor

Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

Quiet Village,the exotic sounds of martin denny,1959,1950,"What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.
Were their views on some points divergent?
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?
In 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
As in what ways?
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
Was it there?
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.
Why was he doubly irritated?
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
Bloom's decision?
A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.
Did he fall?
By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP.
Did the man reappear elsewhere?
Alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
Did Stephen obey his sign?
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.
What did Bloom do?
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.
What did Bloom see on the range?
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.
What did Bloom do at the range?
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.
Did it flow?
Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot?
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?
The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
To shave himself.
What advantages attended shaving by night?
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.
What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886.
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?
In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.
His mood?
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.
What satisfied him?
To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?
The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.
Who drank more quickly?
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three.
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.
Had he found their solution?
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points.
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?
An ambition to squint
At my verses in print
Makes me hope that for these you'll find room.
If you so condescend
Then please place at the end
The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?
Name, age, race, creed.
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?
Leopold Bloom
Ellpodbomool
Molldopeloob.
Bollo edoom
Old Ollebo, M. P.
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?
Poets oft have sung in rhyme
Of music sweet their praise divine.
Let them hymn it nine times nine.
Dearer far than song or wine,
You are mine. The world is mine.
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.
What relation existed between their ages?
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.
What events might nullify these calculations?
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?
Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
Neither.
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?
Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.
Did they find their educational careers similar?
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.
What two temperaments did they individually represent?
The scientific. The artistic.
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.

What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?
Incomplete.
With it an abode of bliss.
Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz. pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo.
Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?
Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary
What?
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's Ho...
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?
The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?
Coincidence.
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?
He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums?
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.
Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?
What to do with our wives.
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.
What system had proved more effective?
Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest.
Example?
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?
By Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).
By Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100.
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation?
Kolod balejwaw pnimali
Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text.
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).
Did the guest comply with his host's request?
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.
What was Stephen's auditive sensation?
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.
What was Bloom's visual sensation?
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.
What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?
Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.
Auditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?
In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare.
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?
Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?
D Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
He broke the jew's windows all.
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?
With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.
Then out there came the jew's daughter
And she all dressed in green.
`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
And play your ball again.'
`I can't come back and I won't come back
Without my schoolfellows all,
For if my master he did hear
He'd make it a sorry ball.'
She took him by the lilywhite hand
And led him along the hall
Until she led him to a room
Where none could hear him call.
She took a penknife out of her pocket
And cut off his little head,
And now he'll play his ball no more
For he lies among the dead.
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?
With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.
Condense Stephen's commentary.
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping.
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.
What other infantile memories had he of her?
15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.
What endemic characteristics were present?
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
What memories had he of her adolescence?
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?
A temporary departure of his cat.
Why similarly, why differently?
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.
In other respects were their differences similar?
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.
As?
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.
In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.
In what manners did she reciprocate?
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation?
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (œ1.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.
Was the clown Bloom's son?
No.
Had Bloom's coin returned?
Never.
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.
Why did he desist from speculation?
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?
Not verbally. Substantially.
What comforted his misapprehension?
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.
I n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM.
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN.
With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?
The 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro.
What did each do at the door of egress?
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?
For a cat.
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity.
And the problem of possible redemption?
The minor was proved by the major.
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.
His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence.
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's gaze?
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.
Both then were silent?
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
Were they indefinitely inactive?
At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.
Similarly?
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
By Stephen:
Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.
Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.
By Bloom:
Heigho, heigho,
Heigho, heigho.
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).
Alone, what did Bloom hear?
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.
Alone, what did Bloom feel?
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi? hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk.
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
Did he remain?
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.
What suddenly arrested his ingress?
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures?
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
Describe them.
One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.
What significances attached to these two chairs?
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close.
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.
His next proceeding?
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.
What followed this operation?
That truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?
Brothers and sisters had he none,
Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.
Why mutable (aliorelative)?
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.
Which volume was the largest in bulk?
Hozier's History of the Russo - Turkish War.
What among other data did the second volume of the work In question contain?
The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when seated at the central table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?
Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.
How was the irritation allayed?
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr?, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.
What involuntary actions followed?
He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

Did the process of divestiture continue?
Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.
Why with satisfaction?
Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.
In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?
Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation #42), of grazing turbary surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage drive nor, on the other hand, a terracehouse or semidetached villa, described as Rus in Urbe or Qui si Sana, but to purchase by private treaty in fee simple a thatched bungalowshaped 2 storey dwellinghouse of southerly aspect, surmounted by vane and lightning conductor, connected with the earth, with porch covered by parasitic plants (ivy or Virginia creeper), halldoor, olive green, with smart carriage finish and neat doorbrasses, stucco front with gilt tracery at eaves and gable, rising, if possible, upon a gentle eminence with agreeable prospect from balcony with stone pillar parapet over unoccupied and unoccupyable interjacent pastures and standing in 5 or 6 acres of its own ground, at such a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as to render its houselights visible at night above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not more than 5 minutes from tram or train line (e.g., Dundrum, south, or Sutton, north, both localities equally reported by trial to resemble the terrestrial poles in being favourable climates for phthisical subjects), the premises to be held under feefarmgrant, lease 999 years, the message to consist of 1 drawingroom with baywindow (2 lancets), thermometer affixed, 1 sittingroom, 4 bedrooms, 2 servants rooms, tiled kitchen with close range and scullery, lounge hall fitted with linen wallpresses, fumed oak sectional bookcase containing the Encyclopaedia Britannica and New century Dictionary, transverse obsolete medieval and oriental weapons, dinner gong, alabaster lamp, bowl pendant, vulcanite automatic telephone receiver with adjacent directory, handtufted Axminster carpet with cream ground and trellis border, loo table with pillar and claw legs, hearth with massive firebrasses and ormolu mantel chronometer clock, guaranteed timekeeper with cathedral chime, barometer with hygrographic chart, comfortable lounge settees and corner fitments, upholstered in ruby plush with good springing and sunk centre, three banner Japanese screen and cuspidors (club style, rich wine-coloured leather, gloss renewable with a minimum of labour by use of linseed oil and vinegar) and pyramidically prismatic central chandelier lustre, bentwood perch with a fingertame parrot (expurgated language), embossed mural paper at 10/-per dozen with transverse swags of carmine floral design and top crown frieze, staircase, three continuous flights at successive right angles, of varnished cleargrained oak, treads and risers, newel, balusters and handrail, with stepped-up panel dado, dressed with camphorated wax, bathroom, hot and cold supply, reclining and shower: water closet on mezzanine provided with opaque singlepane oblong window, tipup seat, bracket lamp, brass tierod brace, armrests, footstool and artistic oleograph on inner face of door: ditto, plain: servant's apartments with separate sanitary and hygienic necessaries for cook, general and betweenmaid (salary, rising by biennial unearned increments of #2, with comprehensive fidelity insurance annual bonus (#1), and retiring allowance (based on the 65 system) after 30 years service), pantry, buttery, larder, refrigerator, outoffices, coal and wood cellarage with winebin (still and sparkling vintages) for distinguished guests, if entertained to dinner (evening dress), carbon monoxide gas supply throughout.
What additional attractions might the grounds contain?
As addenda, a tennis and fives court, a shrubbery, a glass summerhouse with tropical palms, equipped in the best botanical manner a rockery with waterspray, a beehive arranged on humane principles, oval flowerbeds in rectangular grassplots set with eccentric ellipses of scarlet and chrome tulips, blue scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweat pea, lily of the valley (bulbs obtainable from sir James W. Mackey (Limited) (wholesale and retail) seed and bulb merchant and nurseryman, agent for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper), an orchard, kitchen garden and vinery, protected against illegal trespassers by glasstopped mural enclosures, a lumbershed with padlock for various inventoried implements.

When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14h).
What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?
Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.
Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?
In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity.
What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?
Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations.
What lighter recreations?
Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.
Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?
Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc.
What would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry?
Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (Semper paratus), duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).
What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.
Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.
To master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2,000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and John Morley.
How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?
As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of #60 per annum, being 116th of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5% simple interest on capital of #1,200 (estimate of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3rd to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. #800 plus 2 1/2% interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of #64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years stipulated.
What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase?
A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time). The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value: precious stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7-shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper perforate, Great Britain, 1866: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxembourg, 1878): antique dynastical ring, unique relic in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of #5,000,000 stg (five million pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d. to be increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d., 1/2d., 1d., 2d., 4d., 8d., 1s. 4d., 2s. 8d. to 32 terms). A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the circle, government premium #1,000,000 sterling.
Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?
The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.15 by the cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035 the total population of Ireland according to the census returns of 1901.
Were there schemes of wider scope?
A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power), obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation (10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet Company, Lancashire Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway Company, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.
Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis?
Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiery (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.
What eventually would render him independent of such wealth?
The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.
For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?
It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.
His justifications?
As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7ths, viz., 20 years passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.
What did he fear?
The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.
What were habitually his final meditations?
Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.
What did the first drawer unlocked contain?

I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin, formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.
What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2nd drawer?
An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed To my Dear Son Leopold.
What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke?
Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always... of me... das Herr... Gott... dein...
What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?
An old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.
As?
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity of the sabbath.
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.
What idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.
With which attendant indignities?
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing.
By what could such a situation be precluded?
By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).
Which preferably?
The latter, by the line of least resistance.
What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.
What considerations rendered it not irrational?
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.
What considerations rendered it desirable?
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.
In Ireland?
The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.
Abroad?
Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.
Under what guidance, following what signs?
At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.
What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?
#5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.
What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?
Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.
What tributes his?
Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.
Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King.
What would render such return irrational?
An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?
The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).
What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?

What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?
The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.
What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?

What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?
Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.
What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?
A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).
What impersonal objects were perceived?
A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).
Bloom's acts?
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.
How?
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.
What preceding series?
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
Envy?
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.
Jealousy?
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
Abnegation?
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.
Equanimity?
As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.
What retribution, if any?
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.
Then?
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
What followed this silent action?
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?
Absolutely.
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.
How?
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.
What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
Listener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45ø to the terrestrial equator.
In what state of rest or motion?
At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.
In what posture?
Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
Womb? Weary?
He rests. He has travelled.

Where?"
The Ballad Of The Green Berets,ssgt barry sadler,1966,1960,"In the 1960’s, politics and music had a close relationship. Events like the Vietnam War and student protests coincided with a larger and more popular movement of political protest music. While it can be argued that protest music was caused by political events and ideas, it is equally valid to argue that protest music was a significant part of the culture that led to many of the political events seen in the 1960’s. For this reason, it is impossible to conclude that one concretely caused the other. In addition, all protest songs can be used to argue either theory of causality. Because protest music and politics were so deeply intertwined during this time period, neither fully caused the other. However, both helped to influence the society that in turn resulted in political events and protest music.
For protest music to cause political events, or vice versa, the two must first be related. In society, politics and music have been related most fundamentally by songs that discuss politics, or political ideals. While this has existed in society since long before the Vietnam War, the 1960’s was the first era when politically focused music expanded beyond a niche audience and had widespread popularity. In addition, during the 1960’s protest musicians had a close relationship with the protest movement as a whole, which allowed them to reach a broader audience and have a greater effect.
The relationship between music and politics is most evidenced by the existence of songs dealing with political topics. Before the Vietnam War, this was most common is songs discussing unions and the labor movement. “Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite, / who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might? / Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight? / For the union makes us strong.” This example comes from the song, “Solidarity Forever,” written in 1919, and performed by Pete Seeger in 1949. The song gives a direct political commentary on employers and unions, one that is not subtle or hidden. The song argues that unions must be formed to combat the greed of employers, a belief in line with the labor movements of the time. This shows that there had been a tradition of protest songs before the Vietnam War. Another protest song, from 1963, protests racism and societal injustice. “ that even a noble is properly handled. / And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom / stared at the person who killed for no reason… and handed out for penalty and repentance / William Zanzinger with a six month sentence.” This song protests racism within the justice system by telling the story of a black woman killed by a white man who later receives only a six-month sentence for the murder. This song was released in 1963 and provides an example of a song from the mid-sixties using a specific event to protest a social problem, racism, and argue for reform. Both examples show how political beliefs were incorporated into music. Despite the popularity they gained during the 1960’s, political and protest songs were not new occurrences.
In the 1960’s, protest songs were more popular than the protest songs of previous decades. While political music existed before the 1960’s, these protest songs often appealed to only small groups within society. For this reason, much of this protest music, especially that regarding the labor movement, did not reach the widespread popularity that protest songs enjoyed during the sixties. The example by Pete Seeger (shown above) was indicative of most political songs from the labor movement, in that it was designed to be a call to arms for union members, to be used during strikes and rallies. As a result, it had little appeal in other settings, or for nonunion members. This had the effect of limiting the applicability of the song, and decreasing its widespread popularity.
 The limited popularity of protest music was reversed during the 1960’s. This reversal was a result both of political events such as the Vietnam War and the draft, that were important to the entire nation (a contrast to the labor movement, which was only really important to industrial workers and factory owners), and of the modern system of music distribution. The Vietnam War gave protest music a greater importance to listeners, even if the songs did not explicitly discuss the war. In addition, music in the 1960’s had a much more efficient distribution system than was previously available. Radio distributed songs throughout the entire country, and cheap vinyl records allowed listeners access to a greater variety of music. In addition, music charts, like the Billboard Top 100, and later the American Top 40, consolidated the songs played across the country into a single mainstream music culture. This allowed songs to be easily distributed across the entire country, giving them a huge audience and widespread radio play.
These factors let protest songs enter the primarily pop music charts and spread political commentaries and ideas. For example, in 1965, Barry McGuire’s song “Eve of Destruction” reached number one in the US Hot 100 music chart. This song gave a description of war and chaos in the atomic age, stating that modern society has not yet realized it is on the “eve of destruction.” Similarly, SSgt Barry Sadler’s “Ballad of the Green Berets” reached number one on the same chart, and remained there for six weeks. This song was a reaction to protest of the Vietnam War, and patriotically described the Green Berets with the intention of raising patriotic sentiment to support the war. While this does not prove that political protest songs were listened to and appreciated for their political meanings, this does show that songs with very political messages, both for and against the Vietnam War, had very wide radio play. This means that they would have been played across the country, and liked, at least musically, by many. Ultimately, this means that a very large number of people would have heard these songs and at least been exposed to their political messages.
In addition to its popularity, protest music had a very close relationship to the overall protest movement, especially those protesting the war and the draft, furthering the ties between politics and music. Evidence of this was shown in the construction of large music festivals. Woodstock and music festivals like it featured artists like Country Joe and the Fish, whose song “I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-To-Die Rag” directly protested the Vietnam War and the draft, and Jefferson Airplane, whose “Volunteers” advocated for a complete overthrow of the current social order. For a listener to pay to see a music festival, they would most likely be familiar with the music of the bands playing, would like the music, and would most likely agree with the ideas expressed in the music. In addition, many of the people attending these concerts were themselves student protesters. These music festivals were filled with the same young people who led student protests at universities, and featured the same artists that led the creation of protest music.
This support sometimes went beyond just having the same political views. For example, at the Monterey International Pop Festival, a 1967 music festival in California, “nearly all of the performers would play for free, with the proceeds slated to go to youth-friendly causes.” In this case the artists’ support for the political protest movements goes beyond ideological support for the protesters, to monetarily supporting the same things. More broadly, protest musicians also wrote songs about student protests in which they firmly sided with the protesters, supporting their actions and condemning those trying to stop the protests. For example, Buffalo Springfield describes protests in their song “For What It’s Worth” saying, “Young people speakin’ their minds / and gettin’ so much resistance from behind… Step out of line, the man come and take you away.” This gives an example of a protest song that describes student protests, siding with the protesters that made up much of their musical audience.
Protest music is defined as music that discusses or protests the current social and political state. During the 1960’s, protest music and political music reached a wider popularity than if had enjoyed before that time. In addition, radio and vinyl allowed protest music to be distributed more widely than before. This emphasized its political effect. However, was the protest music caused by the politics of the time, or did protest music have its own effect in influencing and creating political events? This issue can be argued both ways, although the dominant theory is that the politics caused protest music, while the secondary theory argues that protest music caused political events. However, the relationship between music and politics in the Vietnam War era was so deeply intertwined that neither can be proven to have caused the other. The dominant view of the causality between protest music and politics is that protest music was caused by political events. At the base of this argument is the fact that a protest is by definition a reaction to an event. Protest music was caused by the politics because political events had to exist to be protested.
For protest music to be caused by politics, protest songs must protest against specific events and beliefs, which occurred previous to the music. This is evidenced by songs that provided commentary on specific events. For example, Bob Dylan reacted to the killing of Hattie Carroll with his song “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll” (quoted previously). In this case, the song was a direct reaction to the killing of Hattie Carroll, and her killer, who received only a six-month sentence. “The story came from a newspaper clipping Gordon Friesen gave Dylan… It was a report of the sentencing that sparked Dylan’s song.” Dylan wrote this song to protest not only the event, but also the larger problems of racism and corruption in the justice system. In this case, an event is used as an example of larger societal problems, but all of the things protested happened previous to the composition of the song, and were the direct causes of Dylan’s writing the song. Another example of a song reacting to a specific event is The Byrd’s “He Was a Friend of Mine.” It commented on President Kennedy’s assassination, saying “He was a friend of mine / his killing had no purpose nor reason nor rhyme… he was in Dallas town… a gunner shot him down.” This song was a reaction to the death of JFK, and the slow, solemn tone of the song and its portrayal of the president as a friend make a sympathetic and mournful depiction of the president, which was in itself a political stance. In this case, the song is a direct reaction to an event, the assassination of president Kennedy, and would not have been written had the assassination not taken place.
For politics to have caused protest music, the protest music must not only protest a specific, previous event, but must also have been dependent on the existence of the political event. If the political event had not happened, then the protest song could not have been written. For example, after the Kent State Shootings, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young wrote the song “Ohio.” It discussed the shootings, in which four students were killed by state troops in the culmination of nationwide student protests, by describing the fallout of the event from the protesters’ point of view. “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,  / We’re finally on our own. / This summer I hear the drumming, / Four dead in Ohio. / Gotta get down to it / Soldiers are cutting us down."" The fact that state troopers had fired on protesters was profoundly shocking both to political protesters and to the creators of protest music. To them, this showed that the government was so firmly supportive of the things students were protesting that they were willing to kill to maintain the social order. This is reflected by the song, which declares that they are now “on their own” because “soldiers are cutting  down.” Ultimately, the Kent State Shootings combined with the reelection of Richard Nixon to begin the decline of the protest movement. These events made clear that their protests would be met with armed resistance that could end in their own death. In addition, Nixon’s reelection made it unlikely that the protesters would make much, if any progress politically. This shows how individual political events inspired protest songs that reacted to those specific events, and showed changes in belief that would not have occurred had the political events not happened.
The challenging view of the causality of politics and protest music is that protest music caused political events. This argues that protest music caused a shift in the political beliefs of its audience. This change in beliefs made the musical audience more opposed to later political events like the Vietnam War and the draft, which in turn led to political events like student protests and tensions over the war. This argument relies on three main points. First, that protest music voiced and argued for a change in political beliefs different from the beliefs held by the majority of society. Second, that protest music succeeded in persuading its audience of these beliefs. Third, that this change in belief led to disagreement with the political events that followed, and, that these tensions led to the political climate of the 1960’s and political events like student protests.
Protest music was unique among the forms of popular music of the time because its purpose was to voice political beliefs. More importantly, the political beliefs voiced by these songs were different from, and in opposition, to the primary political beliefs of the time. The political beliefs these songs protested were generally classified as those held by the older generation, most especially those of the people running the government or other societal institutions. Bob Dylan exemplifies this generational split in “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” saying, “And don’t criticize / what you can’t understand / your sons and your daughters / Are beyond your command… For the times they are a-changin.” This song embodies the change in political beliefs by speaking directly to the older generation, warning that the changing times will affect everyone, from those in power to society as a whole. It also deepens the perceived difference in belief by going so far as to say that the older generation is not even capable of understanding the views of the younger generation. This song also uses an assumption that is used in most protest music- that the older generation is synonymous with those in power and with those who oppose the protests of the younger generation. This generational split was also shown by Jefferson Airplane in their “Volunteers.” This song is one of the most radical of those that advocate for social change, arguing for a violent overthrow of the older generation and those in power. “One generation got old / One generation got soul… Come on now we’re marching to the sea / got a revolution, got to revolution / who will take it from you? / We will and who are we? / We are volunteers of America.” This shows a split in political belief that is so broad as to require an overthrow of the current social order in order to promote their beliefs. This song also advocates for social change because its of connection with the beliefs set forth in Jefferson Airplane’s other songs, like “White Rabbit,” which discussed drug use, and “Plastic Fantastic Lover,” which criticized the fake and plastic nature of society. Both of these songs exemplify the split in beliefs between those in power and those writing protest music, by arguing for a change in, or even overthrow of, those in power. This shows how protest music would have delivered a message advocating a change in political beliefs. However, this music would only have an effect on political events if the message they put forth affected the beliefs of listeners in some way.
Protest music put forth views on politics and society that not only opposed the beliefs generally accepted by society, but also succeeded in persuading its audience of these beliefs. This is shown less by the songs themselves, but instead by their reception. For example, Barry McGuire’s “Eve of Destruction” (mentioned previously) protested against nuclear proliferation and the Vietnam War. “You’re old enough to kill, but not for votin’ / you don’t believe in war, but what’s that gun you’re totin’… you don’t believe / we’re on the eve of destruction… If the button is pushed, there’s no runnin’ away / There’ll be no one to save, with the world in a grave.” This song clearly and rather pessimistically declares that humanity is on the “eve of destruction” because of the threat of nuclear war. The song voices basic pacifist complaints regarding the post-atomic world, beliefs that were also shared by most members of political protest groups. This meant that the political message of the song would have been viewed favorably by its audience. In addition, in 1965 this song reached number one in the US, meaning that it would have had a very wide distribution, and a large amount of radio play, so its message would have been widely known. More importantly, the song presents the political message in a very obvious and clear way, meaning that it would have been harder to miss the meaning of the song when listening to it. This means that the song’s message would have to have been favorable to many to reach that degree of popularity.
Another factor determining the effect of a protest song’s political message would have been the degree to which the politics it discussed would have affected the lives of its audience members. This gave many songs discussing the war and pacifism a greater importance to their audience. As the Vietnam War progressed, more of the young people who made up the musical audience were drafted and sent to go fight. The majority of protest music argued that the war was unnecessary, and the draft unfair, a view that would have been sympathetic to most of the people being drafted. For example, Bob Dylan discusses war and those who control it in his “Masters of War,” saying, “You fasten the triggers / for the others to fire… You hide in your mansion / as young people’s blood / Flows out of their bodies / And is buried in the mud.” Dylan protests the “masters of war” who engineer war for their own profit, disregarding the violence and death they cause. Although it protests more generally against the nature of war, its message would have become more important as the Vietnam War progressed. Because the song was released before the draft was widely instituted, this sentiment would become more important as the Vietnam War led to greater numbers of young people being drafted to fight in Vietnam. In this case, these ideas were put forth in songs released before the political event- the Vietnam War and the use of the draft- and sparked the political sentiments that fueled the protests against the war and the draft. This shows how protest songs helped to influence the political beliefs of their audience, and affected the way in which they reacted to subsequent political events.
As protest music succeeded in changing the political beliefs of its audience, listeners now had a greater disagreement with the political events that followed. This disagreement characterized the political climate as a whole, and led to events like the reaction to the draft and student protests. The tension between protest music and its audience was exemplified by songs like Jefferson Airplane’s “Volunteers” (discussed above), or Tom Paxton’s “Mr. Blue,” a sinister song which gives a dystopic portrayal of those controlling society, painting a picture of a society that expects specific beliefs and actions, and is willing to resort to violent means to maintain those expectations. “You’ve got a slot to fill, and fill that slot you will / You’ll learn to love it, or we’ll break you. / Oh, what will it take, to whip you into line? / A broken heart? A broken head? / It can be arranged. It can be arranged.” This shows how the artists making protest music viewed society and government as coercive and despotic. These beliefs would have put them in direct opposition to everything that the government and society did, as well as the very existence of the current government. This view of society and government fueled much of the reactions on the part of protesters, especially the students protests seen at most universities during this time period. The views of the protesters were shown by many songs about the Vietnam War and the draft, especially Country Joe and the Fish’s “I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-To-Die Rag” (discussed previously). “What are we fighting for? / Don’t ask me I don’t give a damn / next stop it’s Vietnam.” This voices the protesters’ belief that the war was meaningless and unnecessary, and opposes those in the government and in society who wanted them to go and fight in Vietnam. However, this song had a more nihilistic quality. “Country Joe also brought a spirit of protest to Woodstock… his ‘I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-To-Die Rag,’ more grimly pertinent than when it had been released two years ago… said a great deal about how the mood had changed from earlier periods: the hopefulness and sobriety of both Newport and the March on Washington had been replaced by bitter despair and ebullient self-indulgence."" It protested the war, but still was not convinced that anything the protesters did would have an effect. Protest music succeeded in producing music that changed the political beliefs of its audience. This ideological change led to greater tensions between this audience and the actions of the government. This resulted in tensions, which were expressed in the widespread student protests. Protest music written about topics like war and pacifism successfully caused political events like the reaction to the draft, showing how protest music brought about the political climate of the time.
During the 1960’s, political events like the Vietnam War coincided with a large movement of protest music. Artists writing protest songs wrote music that was more popular than previous protest artists, and had a larger impact. Because political events like the Vietnam War and the draft, and protest music were so closely related, each must have had some role in causing or propagating the other. The two main arguments regarding this are either that political events caused protest music by giving musicians something to protest, or that protest music caused political events like student protests by influencing the political climate so that events like student protests happened. However, in this case the lines of causality are so blurred that it cannot be argued that music caused politics any more than political events caused protest music. For example, a song like Barry McGuire’s “Eve of Destruction” can be used to argue both theories. The song protests the threat of nuclear war, and its mention of how “if the button is pushed, there’s no runnin’ away” shows a direct protest to the existence of the nuclear bomb, and the threat of nuclear warfare. This supports the first theory, that political events, in this case the invention of the nuclear bomb, caused protest songs. However, the song was very successful, and its long stint in the Top 100 charts shows that the song would have been heard by many people. This song, and other like it, would have shifted public opinion toward pacifism, and would have heightened public awareness of the possibility of nuclear warfare. This had the effect of shifting public opinion against military ventures like the Vietnam War, and would have led to political events like student protests. In this way nearly every protest song can be used to argue both theories. In this case, protest music and political events were so closely tied that one cannot be determined to have solely caused the other. As a result, neither theory is applicable, so the exact causality cannot be determined.

Brand New Key,melanie,1972,1970,"I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you've got something I need
Well, I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them on to see
I've been looking around awhile
You've got something for me
Oh I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I ride my bike I rollerskate don't drive no car
Don't go too fast but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive
I've been all around the world
Some people say I've done alright for a girl
Oh, yeah yeah
I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone
Sometimes I think that you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you've got something I need
Well I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key

Summertime,d.j. jazzy jeff ,1991,1990,"Drums Please!

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind"
Come Back When You Grow Up,bobby vee ,1967,1960,"Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy, lovin's twice as tough
So come back, baby, when you grow up
You look real good like a woman now
Your mind hasn't gotten the message somehow
So if you can't take it 'n' the goin' gets rough
Come back, baby, when you grow up
I want you girl but your wide-eyed innocence
Has really messed up my mind, yeah-eah-eah
I'd rather you get your very first heartbreak
Somewhere else along the line
Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Some day be a woman ready to love
Come back, baby, when you grow up
Come back when you grow up, girl
You've still got a lotta time left in the world
You'll some day be a woman ready to love
Come back, baby, when you grow up"
Spooky,classics iv,1968,1960,"{Intro}

In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kinda groovy
I call you up and ask you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
At first you say no you've got some plans for tonight
And then you stop and say, ""alright""
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a fellow looks at you
You'd be sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky!


If you decide someday
To stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying
Just like a ghost
You've been a-haunting my dreams
So I propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy
With a spooky little girl like you

Spooky!
Spooky!
I said  Spooky..."

Only The Lonely (Know How I Feel),roy orbison,1960,1960,"The screen door slams, christine's (angelina's) dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy orbison singing for the lonely
(hey) that's me (babe) and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone (in that mirror) again tonight
Don't run back inside, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking
That maybe you (we) ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith (well woman) there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but hey (baby, ah) you're alright
And that's alright with me
This 4/4 she's gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl I gotta get her back out on the street
I know you're lonely like me so baby don't try and fake it
I'm no prince and I can't lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and she's pretty tough to beat
There's plenty of room in my front seat, baby if you wanna take it
Oh roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
It's like the rushing touch, the dirty wings them highway angels wear
Well tonight we're gonna find out how it feels
I'm gonna trade in your wings - for wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
Ah, mama, come take my hand (well now try hard chrissie to understand)
We're gonna ride all the way to the promised land
Oh I'm gonna dance all the way, dance all the way
(babe if you're born with nothing in your hands
Hey it's your only chance)
Well I don't know but baby I've been told
There's something waiting for us, down that dirty road
Oh take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
(oh I wish you would come
So leave what you've lost, leave what's grown old on thunder road)
Well now I bought this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
I got my car parked out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
Well I think we could take it all babe, just you and me
Climb in back baby, the ride's for free
Oh come take my hand, we're gonna ride all the way to the promised land
We'll dance all the way
Oh baby I don't know but I've been told
There's something waiting for us, down that dirty road
If we take our chance, take our chance
Now the season's over and I feel it getting cold
I wish I could take you to some sandy beach where we'd never grow old
Ah but baby you know that's just jive
But tonight's bustin' open and I'm alive
Oh do (baby) whay you can to make me feel like a man
But this 4/4/2's gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl, I gotta get her back out on the street
I know you're lonely like me, oh so don't fake it
And maybe I can't lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and she's pretty tough to beat
There's plenty of room in my front seat
Oh if you think you can make it, climb in (so christine climb in)
This is town full of losers and baby I was born to win"
A Hundred Pounds Of Clay,gene mcdaniels,1961,1960,"He took a hundred pounds of clay
And then He said, ""Hey, listen""
""I'm gonna fix this-a world today""
""Because I know what's missin' ""
Then He rolled His big sleeves up
And a brand new world began
He created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man
Whoa-oh-oh, yes he did

With just a hundred pounds of clay
He made my life worth livin'
And I will thank Him every day
For every kiss you're givin'
And I'll thank Him every night
For the arms that are holdin' me tight
And He did it all with
Just a hundred pounds of clay
Yes he did, whoa-oh, yes He did

Now can'tcha just see Him a-walkin' 'round and 'round
Pickin' the clay uppa off the ground?
Doin' just what He should do
To make a livin' dream like you

He rolled His big sleeves up
And a brand new world began
He created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man
Whoa-oh-oh, yes he did
With just a hundred pounds of clay

People, let me tall ya what He did
With just a hundred pounds of clay"

You're not a kid anymore.)
When people ask of me
'What would you like to be now that you're not a kid anymore?'
(You're not a kid anymore.)
I know just what to say
I answer right away
There's just one thing I've been wishing for
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
Each night I sit at home
Hoping that he will phone
But I know Bobby has someone else
(You're not a kid anymore.)
Still in my heart I pray
There soon will come the day
When I will have him all to myself
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl

And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me, my darling, let me go

You say you're gonna leave
Gonna take that big white bird

What about that brand new ring
Doesn't that mean love to you
Doesn't that mean anything

And I got down on my knees
Would you make me beg you pretty please

If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey

The Battle Of New Orleans,johnny horton,1959,1950,"In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)

We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah, they ran through the briars
(Hup-one-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(One-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go

They ran so fast

Alone Again (Naturally),gilbert o'sullivan,1972,1970,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
All about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
Crazy,gnarls barkley,2006,2000,"I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"
Stagger Lee,lloyd price,1959,1950,"The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down
I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy
""I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat.""
Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said, I can't get you Billy
But don't be here when I come back
Go on, Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44
Said, ""I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe.""
Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, ""Now nobody move.""
And he pulled his .44
""Stagger Lee,"" cried Billy
""Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children
And a very sickly wife.""
Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass
Now look out, Stagg, come on"

They buried you today

Bleeding Love,leona lewis,2008,2000,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding (Oohhh)
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding (I keep...)
Keep, keep bleeding love

Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding

A Lover's Concerto,the toys,1965,1960,"How gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow?
Birds, high up in the trees
Serenade the clouds with their melodies
Oh, see, there beyond the hill
The bright colors of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us just to fall in love
Now, I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me
Oh, don't ever make me cry
Through long, lonely nights without us
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally
Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful"

My life was torn like a wind-blown sand
And a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you, thank you for the gleam that flows its grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you

A very funny joker (he's a bird)
But when he jokes my honey (he's a dog)
His jokin' ain't so funny (what a dog)
Johnny is the joker that's been tryin' to steal my baby (he's a bird dog)
Johnny sings a love song (like a bird)
He sings the sweetest love song (you ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal (what a howl)
To me it's just a wolf dog (on the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy love my baby (he's a bird dog)

Hey bird dog, get away from my quail
Hey bird dog, you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog, get away from my chick

Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own

What he wants he can get now (what a dog)

Daddy's Home,shep ,1961,1960,"You're my love, you're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
It wasn't on a Sunday (Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)
But I made a promise that you treasured
I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away
Daddy's home to stay
I'm gonna be here come what may
Daddy's home to stay"
Could've Been,tiffany,1988,1980,"The flowers you gave me are just about to die
When I think about
What could've been
Makes me want to cry
The sweet words you whispered didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold
What could've been on a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere
Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all
At all

How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night"

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it

Seasons In The Sun,terry jacks,1974,1970,"Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and A-B-Cs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them, I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone

Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone

All our lives, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun..."
Rude,magic!,2014,2010,"Saturday mornin', jumped outta bed and put on my best suit

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be both standin' at that altar
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know

7 Years,lukas graham,2016,2010,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old"

I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so, it couldn't be, No
But try as hard as I might do, I don't know why
You get to me in a way I can't describe
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
I don't care what people say
To me you're more than a child
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair, if ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you in all that you do
But why in spite of our age difference do I cry
Each time I leave you I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say
""I'm going to marry you
Will you marry me, Uncle Ray""
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair, I've told you before ""Don't you dare""
""Get back into bed""
""Can't you see that it's late""
""No you can't have a drink""

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinkin' of her
In everything you say and do

Oh, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I'd been true
I know she'd never be with you

So, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Strangers In The Night,frank sinatra,1966,1960,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever

All that she wants
All that she wants"
Disco Duck (Part I),rick dees ,1976,1970,"Intro
This right here is a vocal exercise
Verses and freestyles, 3 to 1, that's a ratio
Ayo so lemme explain how this is gonna work
When you hear this sound (Gun Cock)
That means I'm about to go in off the top of my head
Everything else is pre written
These verses are all wordplay
The tone and the emotions of the lyrics change
They progress in the same way as the album does
Think of all these verses as the cracks between the songs
It's extra. I want to recap what's been going on and start to hint for what's to come
This is where I, elaborate on what I mean
You know, this’ll, this’ll help explain my ideology
There's knowledge hidden in here that's gonna make the album click together
No Backups, no editing, it’s just gonna be one vocal track ya know?
I’m gonna keep it nice and simple
Simple beat
And I'm a real emcee so I don't need a crazy beat to flex
I just let my lyrics do the talking
So uh, how long did I make this beat?
45 minutes? Yeesh, alright...Let’s go
Verse 1
Ayo, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with N!cky G
I run rap like track like Steve P
Ooh-wee
I got the lyrical heat
The inferno that burns through your journal (Mos Def)
I'm out for blood like a Crip
I'm swashbuckling ships
Put my roots with my loot like a pirate
All my music, Internet pirate-
-ed
I'm violent when my mind is dilate
I spit so much it drips on my own dick
The only thing I'm riding is my own dick
And the only thing I write is my own shit
That's a shot at ghostwriters and my consciousness
So let me tell you what my options is
I can either be pompous or an optimist
And I can even sell celibates if I was a black market auctionist, the new clients monogamous
I got this shit like a gastroenterologist
I like to pop my zits
And be with
A B.I.G. butt Notorious (bitch!)
Shut up and listen I got more christenings to give
I'm a monster like the loch ness
I could ground you up and eat you like sausage
And if you're easily nauseous don't watch this cause
I'll go straight for your esophagus
Just playin, I kill ‘em with kindness
I'm full of life like metropolis
You know I rock this shit
Swing a sword at it like a Boblikin
Leave your one legged friend hobbling
And I got lines like red Robins fries, bottomless
Verse 2
Sometimes I don't believe in myself like I'm heaven sent
Sometimes I don't feel myself, self-celibate
I could save a million lives and find a way to talk myself out of the relishment
Cause nothings ever good enough for a perfectionist
I've been too negligent with my intelligence
I've been a resident inside of being hesitant
Focused on the irrelevant
No longer can that be my precedent
Time to develop my replenishment
And Let my actions become the evidence
I got big shoes to fill now
I grew up and filled out
But a lot of my dreams spilled out
I robbed myself and took the till out
Feeling like I shot myself in the face
With bullet cases
Put holes in a lot of situations
But now I'm trying to raise my innovations
Climb to the top of the Appalachians
Where I can grasp my aspirations
That's why I bleed in every rap that I'm making
Every beat is yeast, I been baking
The lines are the icing to complete the cake
I had patterns of bulimia so I stuff my face
I wilted, but I put new flowers in the vase
Water myself everyday
Sunk in my roots
Opened my eyes, to obtuse
More than right, then left into flight
Got high I'm off my vocal pipe
Then ate the ripe fruit
Happiness is the pursuit
Shoot any dispute
Ain't no problem I can't compute
Ain't no dispute I can't compute
And I'm en route to becoming the progidy
I’m en route to becoming the progidy
I’m en route to becoming the prog…prodigy
I’m en route to becoming to prodigy I was when I was 10
Except now I'm a grown man
I can really do things now I don't have to pretend
Like I used to in my bed-
Room, look at the starts out my window and tell myself ""I'll be there soon""
Verse 3
I started out as whack
I took the time to fine tune my craft
Fast forward my time lapse
Now I rhyme tight with no slack, I'm back, I’m back, I’m back, I’m back
I'm back and you’re addicted to me like smack
So INhale my words like crack
Relax and let your eyes roll back
I'll align your spine with a tap
I can see my abs now I sat up, I got a six-pack now
But that doesn't add up, my hunger should mean I'm Santa Claus fat now
At last I finally found my knack
I took the bite from the apple on your mac
And regurgitated it back into this rap
I got more lines than topography maps
I more obsessed with myself than making sure that you clap
But I know you're sitting there in your chair making your head move forward and back
I molded these rhymes to be harder than a cast
I reed(read) and breathe more jazz than a sax
I stick to my pacts I'm truthful like that
I snack on anything like a pack of rats
I'll give you a smack if you say you hate blacks
But as a matter of fact, I hate black cats
If I see one in my path, fuck that I'll take the long way back
And I'm a scholar in college but don't ever say that I'm frat rap
That's whack crap about smashing fat racks and raping girls with fat asses
IF I EVER SAW THAT HAPPEN I WOULD RIP OFF YOUR NUTSACKS
I kid, but don't give me a reason to create a bloodbath
Chorus
Clips, Clips, Clips, Clips
Reload (Gun Cock)
Reload (Gun Cock)
Reload…Shoot
Freestyle 1
(I see these things, these things that I bring
The metal, wood and clay to which I cling
Which I think
Will be what I die from
So I might as well enjoy it now so why run?
I put the world in my lungs
I think I’ll die young
And spit it to you as the truth from the blunt that I speak
And spit it to you as the truth from the tongue that I speak
Listen to me spit these bars as I’m freestyling)
Verse 4
This is a warpath you can track by the bloodbath
Contractions of a muskrat
Jump the fuck back
I got my palm on my nutsack
My other palm’s in the palms that consist of my dub sac, Ha!
I got a Backwood under my mustache
I hide my eyes with some sunglass-es
I copped for free, fuck your logo fashion
I'm comfortable with who I am, I don't need to be masked in
I'm back and back in as the captain of these captions
An assassin with verb-al actions
You, plus your crew, is still a subtraction
I'm narcissistic I only think about my rations
My mind is the abstract rap contraption so fasten
Your seat belts, this is a wild ride
Resurrection from a mind that died
Guided back into the life of light
Then applied with a wide stride of pride
Never slip or slide
Never tongue-tied
I reside in music to confide
In my thoughts ideas and fears
I'm in gear and I’m not looking at the rear view mirror
I found my career
It appeared at a severe time of fear
I engineered it to be premier
And Now I see with my ears
And I'm in the clear of the frontier
Fight or flight?
Stress me I might take your life
Smite ya with the height of what I cite
Take a bite
I'm a knight of the night
I dwell in the moonlight when the ghouls have goon fights
I'm outright polite face to face
But when I write, I might just put you in your place
I got the sleight of hand, point and case
I work real hard every day's a rat race
Verse 5
I'm about to inject you with the verbal slime
The vegetables of rhyme
Nutrition for your mind
Poke your nerves in your spine
Emcees be all over the place with their rhymes
While mine remain defined
Glued to perfection
I kiss the mic with affection
My mind is taking time for some stretching
Bending galaxies into my verbal collection
My ethics remain the most pristine
You don’t know half the shit I've seen
Drugs, violence and money ain't my scene, that shits obscene
Failure is not in my genome
I eat rappers like amino
Acid I spit, I'm sick make you need chemo
I got the heart of a king, I'm casino
I keep my profile on the d low
That way if I need to snap a neck, I can creep slow
I'm quiet but alert like Cappuccino
For every rhyme you have, I got a kilo
I torpedo my ego of being half Latino with rhymes that are jalapeño
A mean flow, like a lunch money
Bully
I got leverage like a pulley
Pull your body in the gully
Then assassinate ya subtly
Fire rhymes, I’ll boil your blood till its bubbly
I must boil your blood because I can't leave evidence
I can't have a conscious that is decadence
I'm perfecting the elements
So I can raise a hell-ish genesis
Inject ya membranous tissues
With my sentences
Your brain is my new residence
So prepare for ideas of excellence and long nights of restlessness
I'm reckless, I'll erode your skeletal with tetanus
Spit the most venomous
Leave you stranded in a nebulous
Unless you're in for my best interest
I'll show you benevolence
Fly us away on a Pegasus
Let you benefit from my intelligence
My rhymes are the perception of medicine that is perfection
Known to cure cancer, bulimia and depression
That last one is a self-tested assessment
Verse 6
I'm back with a bad habit of being a rabbit and too hop to be toe tag-ged
I'll incinerate you if you discriminately use the term faggot
Bury your skeleton inside of the slime of the maggots
That's the way its gotsta happen if you're a foul mouth bastard who thinks backwards you capsize slacker
Step into my rapture
This is chapter, one
It's do this or do a backwards gun
That last one rhymed with try
You imbecile child step into my trial
Let's see if you follow the crevices or smile
Let's see if you can decipher my rhyme style
It's gold wealth, disguised in stealth
Subliminal messages that tend to melt
Your brain it's actually not good for you health
So maybe you shouldn't listen to me
Maybe you should just do your own thing
But just know I have a swarm of bees ready to sting
Emerging, from underneath my lunula fing-ertips
Talk ya shit, I ain't allergic
In fact I'll probably learn it
Churn it, inside of the pot
Stir it
Take the recipe and burn it
Then emerge it
2.0 the newer version
And now everybody's drinking my syrup
I'm the best in the west let's not get into a stirrup
From CA through Oregon, Washington to Alberta
Chorus
Freestyle 2
(You wanna hear some words?
I don't give a fuck about a verb, or a noun, I'm profound
Sniffing out pounds of herb like a hound
I'm always at work
Spinning pizzas picture perfect round
I got a low-key sound and I'm bound
To have a Loki crown that's golden brown
Pretty girls pucker like a goldfish mouth
I’m about to get a sucker on me down south
I'm losing my marbles like change in the couch
I guess my mindset is my new allowance)
Verse 7
I elope, in these dark thoughts of a man
Reaching for the ends to which they span
I'm creeping on myself I just need the white van
Weighing actions vs. consequences by the gram
I've been blowing myself up like ‘42 japan
I'm the number one rank in any clan
And I'm just speaking frank, Anne
And I’m walking on the plank of the shark tank
My boat already sank so I'd better start to thank
Oil the gears as they crank, swivel the gun on the tank
And I'm the dope boy and this here is dank
Every song has a ploy, I come out with a shank
This ain't a toy, this the gun of a tank
This ain't a coin, this is the whole bank
I'm the dope boy, my product is dank
Verse 8
I’ll hydrate ya like hydrocortisone
I'm in my zone I’ve already flown
Migrated to Oregon
My heads a mess I need a comb
Miss my family kiss ‘em on the phone
I'm up and coming
I'm all up and grown
I’m tryna compare myself to the legend of Davy Jones
I'm in construction watch out for my orange cones
And I'm known for drinking milk so I'm not prone to broken bones
So come at me with your full blown
And problems about the O-zone
Verse 9
I came out, I came out
I came out, I came out
And when my mother came around
She said ""I hate your sound""
I thought ""Fuck you talking bout now?""
She said ""You're not brown, you didn't grow up downtown, sometimes I think you do these things just to see me frown""
I thought ""Fuck off, can't knock me down""
I'm not in this for a crown, I'm in this only for the sound
Who needs to care whether I'm black white or brown?
It's only what I say and convey that counts
I was in the pound, impounded, who let the dogs out?
I may have been lost but I came back found
With a new collar and a shiny name tag on
A whole new lawn of grass to aim and pee on
Eat sleep and play with repeat on
Barking at the mailman to be gone
Cause I don't trust the government
It seems like they're crooked and crumbling
I wanna make my paycheck and not funnel it
Back into paths where I just run a bit
People need structure but government feels fluctuated
Easily hated, but I think we'd hate it if we didn't make it
And if we didn't have laws we would all have died 100 years ago all too faded, it's undebated
Human nature is more destructive than creative
That's why you should praise me for being patient
I got a relation-
-ship with God
And he says ""Dog
It's all backwards, our spots
Responsibility in you, in knocks
You're the new boss, take it out for a shot.""
I'm shocked, for a second my heart stopped and my stomach dropped...
Me and God just flopped...
So the first thing I’mma do is smash the crown with a rock
Burn the throne, no more idols to mock
My idea of leadership is like Spock
Rid of emotion and respect the cock (Atmosphere)
Eat, sleep and fuck is what we got
Take it back to the basics of the block
I need your help so give me your hand
There's a revolution out there for us to understand
All of us create it, there's no plan
Shits been spinning the same like a fan
Let stand, and create a template to end all of what we debate
This is a race, keep your pace
Chorus
Freestyle 3
(It courses through my brain
It-it-it-it’s in my sayings
It’s every motherfucking thing that I’ve been playing
And every, I’ve been, I’ve been spraying
Running through these god damn lyrics every day in
Day in, night out
Cause I’m a dark knight right now
I’m under the moon, I’m literally on Mt. Baldy
You motherfuckers ain’t know shit about the shots that I’ve be calling
Man what the fuck am I talking about?
I’m just, I’m just high right now
I, I’m too high, I’m too high
Literally I’m like 2000 feet above, above sea level
Check my, check my fucking levels
I need to turn the gain down I sound distorted
Man my rhymes are so nice it’s like I’m imported)
Verse 10
Ayo I was six feet deep, in something that I dug
But I just pulled myself up outta that rut
I’m here to stir a muck
Bring the fuck with the ruckus
Ooh I'm so luscious
This is how many fucks I give
(……..)
Hut hut, Andrew Luck
I'm back in play
Or re le, Chez Jose
This is where I lay this is where I wanna stay
Every night every day
Blow up like Michael Bay
Actually fuck fame, that shit cray-
-fish, if you in it for the money you a bitch
I don't say this often but you can suck my dick
Egotistical pricks I turn into bowels
I'm a wild dog you want to hear me howl?
I'm like a soul on ice with the solstice at night
Insomniac werewolf with a bite
I scream for ice cream but I wouldn't do much for a Klondike
Don't believe the hype, they're just alright
(but G the motherfucker who strikes with might)
Verse 11
I got bars that’ll take me further than mars
I’ve known it from the start so I’ve been perfecting my art
Your part, is not much in my scheme
Just make sure you scream when I’m on stage
Have everybody listening
My life’s pristine
Wake up and smoke weed
Say “Hello” to the team
We just trying to get some C.R.E.A.M
Wu-Tang, who saying
That I’m playing? I’m a rap abomination
Emcee’s praying that I won’t slay ‘em
On their own beat, on their own street
And hear their mother’s weep
As I leave a card by their feet
Says “I ended the blindness, Sincerely the Finest”
Ooh-wee
I’ll always kill ‘em with kindness
Ooh-wee
I got the lyrical heat
The inferno that burns though your journal (Mos Def)
I put my sweatshirt on so that’s word to Earl
I expel pearls, I’m not talking about the necklace
I’m reckless, I’ll always eat a pussy out for breakfast
I’m next bitch, so don’t judge this dude
You don’t know what the fuck I’ve been through
Too, much has been put into this
So I ain’t leaving until I have a gold fucking necklace
Yes, I, I must spit to impress
Before I’m the next best to put the mic to rest
Mos Def, taught me mathematic tactics
Most rap is lacking
So I’ll start the reaction of (INhale) in action
That’s oxygen in action
I got L’s being passed ‘n’
I can sleep when I’m dead so for now let me rap
Verse 12
I'm leaping off cliffs to expand my wingspan
Morphing my brain into a sphere
So every angle that appears is clear
Gain the ability to sneer in the face of fear
Fear is nothing
Compared to what I've been cooking and stuffing
Inside the turkey
It's murky and doesn't understand what is mercy
It's out for blood and boy am I thirsty
Swimming in dreams of virgins and wine
Disembodied the shrine
Gave it a design
Of thought, individuality
Acts of kind with immortal minds
Death is just a race against time
To see who can accomplish what within it
Death to the men who undermined women
And I feel as if I never will die
As I can accomplish whatever I try
Apply my mind
Into the eyes and look right through the sky
My soul is as soft as the fuzz on a peach
Embodying every freak that I meet
We have more genes
Than every speck of sand on a beach
What does that mean?
Where is the gene
That makes an act of mean?
Where is the gene
That births a queen?
Where is the gene
That causes my lucid dreams?
Where is the gene that made G
The Jesus of DJ-ing
And spitting this lyrics?
(You know this shit is more than just appearance
This shit is really, it goes deep inside of my veins
It courses through my sayings)
Verse 13
It's me and my words against the world
I talk a lot so I don't need a referral
You can't unrecord, so this shit is eternal
I’m smooth with my verbal and this beat is fertile
So I fuck it, every night tuck it
Into bed, wake up she gives me head
Then puts her head on my stomach
She tells me she loves it and loves when
I unbutton what's covering her
And plummet into her muffin
Pussy so sweet
Caramel, chocolate vanilla and poppy seed
Yo I'm papa G
Word to b poppa I g
I see, hip-hop properly
I'm about to take radio rap out of poverty
Run an iPod monopoly with a free music economy
Wreck the record label my philosophy
I've overcome mountains
You got anything else that can stop me?
You best eat your broccoli
Cause you gon’ need to be real strong to stop me
Except I ain’t stopping
Chorus
Freestyle 4
(Except I ain’t stopping
You copy?
Think about what you say before you're sorry
That's why I'm old fashioned like Atari
I'm on my grind doing Ollie’s
All these raps are quality
I don't have a favorite one, I'm about equality
I'm in the trees like a koala be
I got the world's best heart, I'm fatherly
That's why all these crazy bitches want to have their fawn with me
Quit calling me, I don't wanna be bothered
You see, I've met a whole lot of you ladies
And you’re all fucking crazy
Had one girl fake a pregnancy
Expecting me to stick around
All these women try and tie me down with a baby
Ah ""Just put it in without a condom"" I've heard way too often
Followed by ""It's alright, I took the pill""
Bitch I don't trust you and that's how I feel, Ha!
I ain't amused but you're a muse for me to use
Always spew the holy holy like in the pew
I got a birds eye view and sick with my own flu
With which I might fly by and kill you
Catch that or was that too much for you?
I hope you caught it cause now your finally dead
Now I don't have to waste any lead
You're so-so but I'm every thread
And all your opinions are just things that I’ve already said)
Verse 14
My lips are always chapped
From all the air I drag
What goes in must come out and
My sentences are bad
My soul is at the end of a mag
I see a man with a bag
I look the other way, I see the man with the segregated flag
Which way do I go? What do you think?
You take me stupid or someone on the brink
Of world peace and humanity in sync
And all of this within an arms reach
So I can't blink until I find the missing link
Verse 15
21 years in the making
And the whole time I been going bacon
I think I've been pacing
I'm near my final destination
Life isn't patient
It wants what it wants and takes it
And then it sees what it wants and creates it
These are the basic rules of life
Day after night, until the end of time
So why do we fight?
What is wrong? What is right?
The only lesson I've learned is don't believe the hype
Can we even learn? Or is it just lessons that we have to earn?
Why do we yearn? Life always ends in turn
So why do I smoke the fern? Is it the INhalation of the burn?
Why do I like to curse? Why do I like to flirt?
Why do I write this verse? What really are words worth?
Do they really serve a purpose or is it getting lost in the universe?
Should I try to fly like the birds, or dig tunnels with the worms?
Why do I want these things?
Are the answers really what I search?
I'm trying to answer life before I lie in the hearse, yeah!
Verse 16
I see, I see hip-hop as a gun
It gives power to the man who yields one
But it gives a whole nother level of power to the man who really knows how to wield one
Same thing how it takes talent to go semi pro
But it takes a whole lotta work to go professional
It's a big difference
It's the big leagues vs. the amateurs
It’s the circumference vs. the diameter
The worker vs. the manager
The peasant vs. the chancellor
The black house cat vs. the panther
It's me vs. hip hops ramblers
Quit being inconsiderate
And taking away from an art form
So you can get your liquor in
That was built to make a difference
Through brutal honesty and enlightening the policies
Of what us inaudibly
To common to see
NBC, just wants gossip
I'm here in the form of the long lost prophet
Allah reincarnated with Muhammad
Serving the blood of my heart in a goblet
Knowledge of an entire life in every droplet
Flow of a faucet that's sick like vomit
That last line is a composite of a sonnet
I'm preparing to pay with my life
And my words are my breath, and wallet
Is being held under a knife
The pressure is precise
The ethics of a man I like to exercise
Experience is the best teacher of wrong vs. right
So don't believe the hype
I'm not always right despite being a white, man
I'm right because I stay up at night to write my insight until I can't feel my hand
This is something that's bigger than me
And I won't quit until I can put it in between my teeth
Verse 17
They say what I say ain't as important as what I do
But I'm confused, because what I bring to you is the same two
Hold up Steve let's sniff out the Blues Clues
This one's sweat on my neck like J. Crew
Let's sniff out the Blues Clues and take a J cruise
Chains of thought weigh like slave shoes
Not what you should see but what they choose
It's what they put on our shoes with swoosh labels
We released information over the Internet for free to anyone who was able
With cells into portable tables and cables
Chorus
Freestyle 5
(Uh, I don’t know what to say, uh
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup
I can be an emcee or I could be the drummer
I can make more sound than the engine of a Hummer
Bummer, that you have to sit the sideline
While I spit raps and ride the high rise
You need to climb a mountain just to get in my eyesight
And I can make this real messy like we was in a pie fight
That's 3.14
What’chu know about that? Nothing? Well there's the door
I suggest you still get out while it's easy like a whore
Cause if you stand there and rebuttal when I come back around there's gonna be a Whole. Lot. More.)
Verse 18
My face been multiplying acne like I'm a mathlete
I’m feeling crappy like 2015 Crabtree
I feel like a has be, so I drink coffee, until the break of dawn
While rapping, zeppelin rocking, ignorance the new armeggadon
I've had lots of time to reflect the concept of many wrongs
Addiction to electronic restriction has humanity dead and gone
Has everything I think been thought? Is it just the credits on?
Am I ever creative or just invasive like Jason Statham in The Italian Job? That's a whole different song. Pause. New topic
Verse 19
I’m watching the blur of green trees and leaves
Feeling like nothing ever mattered
I can feel the vibration through the cars tire feet
Recline and the rocks’ll start to sing you to sleep
Elevation is what we seek, the summit is under my feet
This forest is quiet no birds cheep
Fresh air meant to INhale deep
The smoke from the blunt starts to seep
Into my lungs take in the heat
Smoke on the view, gaze on the haze
Baker, I’m covered I'm fog
Crepes with a glaze
Of hazelnut gourmet sauce
Topped off with whipped bliss of the gods
Smoke smog with my dawgs
Smash, no items or mods
Not a monster but a cookie hog
I'm pretty odd, do whatever I feel when I wake up
Too many things to do than stay put and stay stuck
Add a little flavor with a spray of the shaker
I'm a creator who just gave this crater
And it's big as fuck
You could roll in its deep but it’s like the wheels on the bus
Darkness makes you ponder if the difference of life is on purpose or luck?
Why am I me and not a big buck?
Why does my head point to happiness and big bucks?
Why is my head not the shape of a duck?
What if monkeys are secretly smarter than us?
What if they're the ones running the experi-munts?
They act dump to puppeteer us with ropes
You can't understand any other life except the one yours chose
But yet all our electrons rotate so close
Created the difference between inland and coast
Dead and living folks
And the concept of hope
(Isotopes and molecules
I be running through this shit that I cule)
Verse 20
I can think
Though any situation
I got the bossest consciousness
Filled with the rawest faucet
Of flawless thoughts that blossom
Into colossal gospel
My words are fossils
Here to stay
Spread and spray
From Boston to Austin to the bay
I display an awesome buffet
Of parfaits that convey
Past clichés and will live on past my day when I pass away
I’m molding my days like clay
And churning the furnace to not decay
So preserve my DNA
Like fine cabernet
Wine
And sip it on my judgment day
Eat my words like sorbet soufflé
At my cafe
The fires crackling
My mouth is babbling
Trying to tackle what happening
Around me, but sadly
I don't think I'm scratching
The surface of the half of it
I'm passing time trying to remind
Every pacifist that they're accurate
I'm trying to ejaculate the immaculate all over your face
Make ya taste my miraculous case
I'm trying to calculate every single angle
Untangle hatred
And become the grateful patrons
Underneath those clothes we're all naked, we're all related
So let's hug each other, snap the moment and paint it
Make it a song on everybody's playlist
And label it the greatest
Chorus
Freestyle 6
(Oh you’re a fat ass? Boo-hoo
Quit going to McDonald’s and make your own fucking food
It’s not rocket science it’s not even voodoo
Don’t eat donuts motherfucker get your head right
And at night, I don’t obey the law of red lights
I do donuts what I drive, I spin around in my mind
I got the eyesight of the three blind mice times thrice
That’s nine, that’s nice, I don’t listen to Christ
I don’t like being told what not and what to do
Call me a rebel but that’s just what I’m meant to do
I’m amendable but if I led, I’d be incredible
Don’t run out of lead in your pencil
Cause my lessons’ immensful)
Verse 21
I’m on 16th alley in the Cascade valley
North of Cali
I been working out my mind like Bally
Cooking something up on the galley
Putting beats in body bags, add up the tally
My raps are pieces of art, I got a whole gallery
I can pep talk a rally into a riot for the finale
Flow sweeter than berries, like Halle
Ooh I like them caramel girls
The scandalous girls
Fuck me like an animal girls
Bring out my instincts
Make me go primate
Annihilate your eardrums
With vibrate, tions
I hydrate with nitrate
So I flow with nitrous
Let loose like on Friday night with a pipe
Packed with kief of the leaves
That allows me to catch Z's
Cause I don't sleep, Geez Louise
Nicky G, He's the missing piece of the puzzle
Between peace vs. muzzles
I paint a picture with my ease-l
I got a lot of power I need diesel
With a flow so lethal my language needs to be illegal
I got the nose of a beagle and the talons of an eagle
I turn ya into fecal then roll you around like a dung beetle
I’ll stab you with a bees needle and put you in the fetal
Position, a fucking animal on every composition
159 is the addition of my cognition
So when I'm speaking you need to shut the fuck up and listen
Just kidding
But I'm just more than a musician
I got food for thought that's nutrition
I'm a poetic dietician
And fuck paying tuition
I'd rather spray my ammunition
I'm in a high gear transmission
And I just sparked the ignition
Verse 22
I been creeping through the peep hole
Weed O's till my feet slow
Shoot a beat then I reload
Nicky G, G is for giant with my fe-fi-fe-flow
Stomp, the ground erodes
Yo he flow like he got the cheat codes
He is not an equal
King Midas touch when he flow, he speak gold
Deceitful, like Rumpelstiltskin
Like Rumpelstiltskin
Chilling with the fill in villain
I’m just your enemy until I make a killing
I’m throwing curveballs like Curt Schilling
I'm iller than a chinchilla that has ten children
Fighting off evil women like Scott Pilgrim
I swear I've met more than a million
And I don't do this for them
I do this for the feeling
I do this for the Chem-
-istry of my brain stem
Raise the mayhem
Out my cranium
Not the best
But def-
-initely in the top ten
And offend-
Ded if you think diff-er-ent
Not what I want but I spit what I am
Verse 23
I may be introverted and shy
But in my mind, Lies
A consciousness, where
I got enough confidence and competence to accomplish an entire continent
I got a horoscope of a broke metronome
I'm the holy ghost giving every note a home
I’ll straighten out your head like a comb
I'm flowing Rivers like Joan
Get girls wet like boats
I float with ease
I got a whole lotta ways to cut the cheese
I got an army of chords and keys
I breathe these raps like breeze
I got your hands up like I told you to freeze
But unlike the police, I'm pro free
I’m digging tunnels underground where the moles be
Dip me like guacamole
I'm raising all you kids like Angelina Jolie
I'm a god, on the low key
Like a bass note
I was born in the winter I'm straight cold
I’ll give you a splinter with a dull icicle
I’ll break the ice in your skull
Throw your corpse off the hull
You'll feed the seagulls
My words should be illegal I'm so lethal
I got retrieval skills like a beagle
Snatching the egg of an eagle
Which I feed my people to lead past the cathedral to laugh in the face of evil
And I won't stop until the Devil lays peaceful
And all men are treated equal
I got a sequence of sequels
This is just the prequel of the needle
Chorus
Freestyle 7
(I just smoked a blunt
My body is retarded
My mind has departed
Rolled a back and sparked it
The moon isn't even the farthest
I've traveled, through galaxies and seen through fallacies of the most lethargic
That last line was a hiccup
That last beat I made, I need to turn the kick up
Make my vocal pop because listen how I spit luck
Gain respect and get trust
Maintain flexed, Nick’s
Maintain flexed, Nick the mista
It's when the pressures on that defines who you are
Are you subpar or you can reach the bar?
Except the bar is meant to be lifted, and I'm the motherfucking gifted!
Who be spitting and kicking all of this god damn different
Things that I’ve been lifting)
Verse 24
I'm like a magician I can disappear into thin air
I brainstorm so much I wake up with Einstein’s hair
I'm in a race against a tortoise and I'm the hare
But this ain't the story you used to hear
I'm trying to rewrite history with a flare so rare
My skins so fair I can give you a ghost-like scare
But in reality I'm sweeter than a pear
With a mistook left hook that can leave you impaired
My words sting like Nair
And they slap like a snare
I rhyme snuggly like a big teddy bear
My flow spreads like a spiders web
Step into my lair
I'm making the world change, I’m not waiting like Mayer
I spend my time as a god like creator
So if music dies I can rise and be the savior
Verse 25
Ain't no limits to this gift
I'm tired of cheese and crackers I want to live the Ritz
Bliss, death has given me a kiss
But that's another story that's was some shit
Let's just say I appreciate what it means to live
I hold in my genes(jeans) my kids
And honest, I hope they never get my lisp
Money power and happiness, I can't scratch away this itch, it's a bitch
My soul could never be beat even by Chuck Norris' fists
My goal is to become a young enormous prince
My name on all the tourists’ lists
A camera click with a horde of pics
Give all the Swedish chicks a foreign dick
I feel immortal with this
Take a shot I pray it miss, cause my sleeves' got more tricks
Too many things I want to fix
I'm just a kid I eat Trix
I want to get under your skin like ticks
The clock ticks and tocks I think time is a paradox
I have too many thoughts to talk
And if you're racist, suck my cock here's a box of dicks
That last line was a little bit ridiculous
But that’s ok because I’m named Nicholas
And I try to stay fresh and packed like pickles is
I have a high ego it's hard to get with this
Victorious, of the people, my name is Nicholas
Verse 26
I'm here to steal the loot, kick the boot
I got two, truces but killed Usylluss with his own trident
I'm walking in Stride chewing Trident
I got about 5 packs of Dentyne Ices
Juicy Fruits in Orbit around Hubba Bubba and Double Mint
I chew ‘em all I don't care what the price is
Truth is, my crew chew gum or they're left lifeless
I might smite this, so tell me what the hype is
I'm hip and I hop like the bunny from Energizer
Summon my chariot I got the Christ-risen Chrysler
No more V-Techs and no more ricers
I ball all day Like Mike in a white shirt
Lurk all night ya might get hurt
Or shot by all my squads Super Soakers
Do it for fun like we was some poachers
Taxiderm your head real big like “yeah, yeah we're some big boasters”
Wake up every morning staring at it with a cup of Roasters
Chorus
Freestyle 8
(Now don't get me wrong I like ass and tits
But I'd much rather see a girls assets
If she doesn't have good morals I'll send that chick backwards
And sit back and roll a Backwood on my lips
And smoke till my lungs hiccup
Smart girls are the one’s that gets my dick up)
Verse 27
Hip-hop never died, I just woke her up with a kiss
Lashes exposed her eyes, they told me she loved her Nick
Slipped in with my dick, now I'm addicted to it
All it is, is finding new ways to lick the clit while I spit
New ways to express the messages I give
She indulges my bliss, told me “Don’t stop, don't quit
I want you to give me every last inch”
In the morning I don't split because I found my niche
She's holding a crown and I'm the fresh young prince
I won't call her a bitch, she's too precious to hit
Even is she's got blood, I'll go down like a Crip
Verse 28
I be puff-puff passing on the medical
But passing over edibles
I'm incredibly credible
My knowledge goes deep as if I got several
Minds inside my cranium
If Big Bills is closed then I'm gonna be breaking in
I’m about to eat balls cheesed to perfection
And slices known to give saliva erections
I'm just messin’ but I remain sincere with my adolescence
I ran 5 miles today gasping for breath and
Everyday I eat Oatmeal for breakfast
I'm trying to grow a mustache
But it's hard when I still act like a rug rat
It feels great in Colorado to have the sun back
I'm chasing nirvana like I run track
Yanni rolling backwoods
Smoke don't make me rap good
Time slows so much it goes backwards
It's the fountain of youth and that's word
Backwoods of fat herbs
And slaphappy rap masters
The rock I'm on makes my ass hurt
Stomach rumbling makes me want to go to the crapper
Oh wait I'm on the beat though
Sit and think about that one for a minute
I’m aiming for big game shoot and skin it
Hang the antlers to remind myself I’m driven
And I want to be livid in Bolivia
And flip all of our media
J.K. Rowling in the deep
Harry potter nerd but Adele puts me to sleep
Me and death been known to meet
Am I lucky or too grim to creep?
Piling my dreams into a heap
Then repeat through my speech
Verse 29
I used to dream about the day that I would die
But now I can't stop eating it up like pie
I got a sweet tooth for equality and love
And if you're full of hate I won't share my drugs
Addicted to lick the sweat on my upper lip
Never will I slip when I’m passionate
I've always been too cocky of myself
I held up my ego like a belt
I've had days I felt like my heart could melt
And others where all I did was puff top shelf
I can break your focus
Trick you with hocus-pocus
Bullshit ya with no bogus
Leave your Solo shot Hope-less
I see more stem and flower than florists
I'm the hour of power with a flow so enormous
Talk is cheap just show me where the smoke is
Within the universe we're all just tourists
I eat chips and churros at Torres
I got the horns of a Taurus and
I drank the potent potion of emotion in motion
Now I'm feeling like my soul was stolen
Verse 30
I don't have a DJ, it's just me
I also don't have a free day because I'm also an emcee
I hear these kids rapping about how drake got a Wusa
But what's even cooler is I can play 12 scales on a tuba
I wanna hear a jazz diss track
The battle of back-to-back saxes
Bass lines with more scales than basses
Attacking guitar axes
Piano strings springing like a mattress
Improvised not practiced
That’s why my rhymes are going down as a classic
Chorus
Freestyle 9
(Practice today makes the perfect practice tomorrow
Lessons on loan I'm living lavish on borrow
All I know is I'm living Jack-ish like Sporrow, Sparrow
Did you catch that? most don't listen…
Robert's in raves and rancers of dancers
More wrong that right? Schrute Dwight
And mama Mary made mad marvelous muffins making Martha managing maniacs maybe moping mopeing mild Mark missing memories, her enemy...
Haha, what the fuck did that even mean?
I don’t know, but it sounded heavenly
Show me someone better than me
Uh, I just smoked a Backwood, I didn’t even get that high
I got buzzed as fuck though, that Back-tobacco dry, haha
And I'm back in the woods rolling backwoods that are that good
I'm a slaphappy rap master
My favorite sound is the sound of laughter
I do unseen good deeds like I'm Casper
I've touched more lives than a badass pastor
I'm shutting on this beat I treat it like the crapper
I know too many lines to be a bad actor
I'm so much more than just a rapper
Listen to my whole album then tell me why after
And I'm just breaking the ice, this cypher’s just the fracture)
Outro
Haha, Yeah!
Goddamn that was good
Not bad for uh, eight takes?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eight takes
Who cares man? I’m high right now
(Eight’s my lucky number motherfucker
Like Chris Tucker, and Jackie Chan I be kicking it
I’m getting more livid in
Splitting these dividends
To everyone that be living in)
Ayy, alright
It’s like, oh shit, it’s 3:40 in the morning right now
Um, my computers’ got like eight percent battery left
Yeah, it’s time to call this quits man
But uh, I still got half an album left
I’ll see you on the other side of the moon, Disc 2
This is fun but I gotta go to bed man
Ah fuck it who am I kidding? (I’m not going to bed
I’m about to, I’m about to go home and uh
Ya know just kick more rhymes out my head
Smoke a little dope till my eyes red
Go to another planet where I can pretend)
Haha, alright I’m outta here
I got motherfucking Clips! Clips!
(Give me a beat, I’ll shoot and reload
Anytime, I’ll hit the three-point like a free throw
Yo you see me on the street, give me a word!
Ya know I don’t want you to think I’m making these freestyles with a cheat code)
Haha, alright for real
Third time’s the charm
G out, I’ll see your motherfuckers after the interlude
I got Clips!"
Sunshine On My Shoulders,john denver,1974,1970,"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you the day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high
Sunshine almost always"
Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,b.j. thomas,1970,1970,"Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin'
Me"

"Billy, Don't Be A Hero",bo donaldson ,1974,1970,"The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line
And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife
And as he started to go
She said, ""Billy, keep your head low.""
Billy, don't be hero
Come back to me

The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, ""We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground.""
I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men.""
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said


I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud
He died that way
I heard she threw the letter away"
ANNIE's SONG,john denver,1974,1970,"You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you
Come let me love you, come love me again
(Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again)

You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again"

Shove it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady
Hey sexy lady
Girl, you drive me crazy
You dance so fine
And you're right on time
Girl, you're driving me out of my mind
If it wasn't for the girl
Sitting next to me

You got me hypnotized
Soul mesmo-ized

Save The Best For Last,vanessa williams,1992,1990,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing
You're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
You went and saved the best for last"

Afternoon Delight,starl,1976,1970,"Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been ""when it's right, it's right""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Like nibbling a little afternoon delight

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun gone down

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight

Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you've gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of my memory, you wander on back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you've gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams

So Much In Love,the tymes,1963,1960,"As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two, that we don't know what to do
So in love (so in love) in a world all our own (so in love)
As we stroll by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two, no one else but me and you
So in love (so in love), so much in love (so in love)
So in love (so in love), so much in love (so in love)
We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, love you my darling
Can you tell it in my touch?
When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So much love have we two, just can't wait to say ""I do""

My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down

A Thousand Miles,vanessa carlton,2002,2000,"Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory

'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

And I still need you
I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh-oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?

Bed Of Roses,bon jovi,1993,1990,"Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died


Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses"

I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day

Sealed With A Kiss,brian hyl,1962,1960,"Intro
Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer
Darling I promise you this
I'll send you all my love every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there
I don't want to say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss"
Red Rubber Ball,the cyrkle,1966,1960,"I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only
Starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running, never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball
Oh, I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now

Sunshine Superman,donovan,1966,1960,"Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah!
A you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand
I'll pick up your hand"
Come Back To Me,janet jackson,1990,1990,"Come...

Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go

Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
How I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me

Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back

Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are
I love you

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go
Not able to let go
No, I won't let you go, no

I don't know what else to say
No, no, no, no"
Be My Baby,the ronettes,1963,1960,"The night we met I knew I needed you so

Blue skies with forest green (water)
Not myself, but they know it's me (oh yea)
Keep it wet, water please. (Oh yea)

Resurrection day, I'm reunited with the family
Couldn't help but hear how they was dissin on the Grammy
All the mask you wear that let me know that you can't stand me
Baby always keep a fresh fit like the nanny, and I heard that you got that fresh kit called xannies
Don't think for a second I can't get you out them panties
I eat it till it's gone, so keep it fresh like Mannie
I done f**ked up the game before they could ask, ""can he?""
Threats on my freedom, twelve don't even wanna can me
So please get the f**k out of my way, Stanley!

They say God I'm so glad that you're home they say I hope that you're staying this time for long

Distance, I know you really miss this and we finessed everything sort of like a piss test
Kiss this, like kiss kiss, that lovey dovey, I'm sick shit, I think you need to roll out all up in my business

Not agitated or stressed out, realizing I'm blessed now, I don't even gotta say it
Khaled , ""We the best Now!"" One thing I should mention, I'm driving us to ascension. Requested us an extension and what we get
Xxxtentacion. (Water)

You said that, ""This was Easter!"" But it still feel like Christmas, so what's on my wishlist, a bad b*tch or maybe two, if you act right I'm talkin to you, cause you know what we bout to do
Drippin on you like popsicles
Stay above all obstacles
Are we getting there that's logical
You need water for your follicles
Designer on me like zombies
Dead ass don't remind me
I'm here dog, and you found me
Just make the call, dial me
I been running with the mask off
If they don't fund me Ima blast off
I think I know what you mad bout
Just give me time we can cash out
I can't wait to serve you up a plate
Keep a smile right on your face
Finna drop on your birthday
All for your love in the worse way

I need pussy (oh yea)
Please don't push me (oh yea)
Cause I need pussy (water)
Please don't push me (oh yea)

I was pushing weight tryna change my face then I felt the weight, scraped the food off my plate
Tryna keep my faith at times I lose it everyday
Niggas in my face damn near like everyday
Asking me a question like, ""JaM where you stay?"" Gang gang family from the gulf to the Lakes
History repeats but I'm just tryna change my fate
Kane in '03 I snatch the mask off my face
The weed had me on another level was it laced?
I know that I'm good, but don't forget that I'm great
Moms got my back so we in a good place
All she want me to do is spray it like mace
I had to break free cause I ain't wanna catch a case, and best believe when I leave I'm leaving this with no trace
Gotta drink my water, water gotta hydrate
& no I ain't dead, I'm just in a higher place"
Cold Sweat - Part 1,james brown ,1967,1960,"I don't care, about your past

When you kiss me
When you miss me
Hold my hand
Make me understand
I break out - in a cold sweat
Ho! Uh! Ho!

I don't care, about your wants
I just wanna, ha, tell ya about the do's and don'ts
I don't care about the way you treat me, darlin', ha

AHH, let me have it"
Silhouettes,herman's hermits,1965,1960,"Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they made
Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block
Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved your my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah"
Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing,marvin gaye ,1968,1960,"Oooh, babe
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing.  No, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, honey
I got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can see or come to me when I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
Oooh, I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know?
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I play my game of fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together.  (Oh, oooh.)
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there
Oh
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh, Marvin.  (I know, honey.)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (So glad, so glad.)
(Oh, baby.) Ain't nothing like the real thing

Bullets In The Gun,toby keith,2011,2010,"They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea

Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die

Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah

We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air

Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun"

Both Sides Now,judy collins,1969,1960,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feathered canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From Win and Lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"

Do You Know The Way To San José,dionne warwick,1968,1960,"Do you know the way to San Jose?
I’ve been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two
They’ll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They’ve got a lot of space
There’ll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you’re never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

I’ve got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

Oh, L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two
They’ll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I’ve got lots of friends in San Jose
Oh, do you know the way to San Jose?
Hmm, can’t wait to get back to San Jose"

Selfish One,jackie ross,1964,1960,"Selfish one why keep your love to yourself
Oh oh yeah
It's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf

It seems like you built a fence around your heart and afraid that sharing
Might tear it apart and ya pass up every chance at the start of romance oh
Oh oh oh oh Selfish one why keep your love in store oh oh yeah you think
It's steel that will keep forever more oh oh oh oh oh but steel wears out
Through weather and age and a heart could break down in a lonely stage you
Better let your heart down mate, before it's too late
You let so much time pass by, and I find myself still giving you the eye
Then you must have realized, cause much to my surprise you're making eyes
At me Is it really you?
Now, selfish one you're walking me to my door
Oh oh yeah
Selfish one, you never did this before
Oh oh no
Without a chance to resist, your lips met mine
You begin to let your lovelight shine
And I can see that you're really on the ball, and
You're not selfish at all

A Place In The Sun,stevie wonder,1967,1960,"Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on, moving on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on, moving on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on, moving on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on, moving on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun"

Been so good to me
I've been unfaithful, darlin'
I've caused you misery
A feeling of guilt

A moment of weakness, darlin'
Caused me to stray
Your trust in me, dear
I threw away

When I look
Look into your eyes
I can see the hurt, baby
That you feel inside
Although I hurt you, baby
You never once complained
It makes me feel, sweet darlin'
That much more ashamed
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt
Runnin' down my face
Tears that only you, baby

This guilty feeling
Tearin' me apart
With every step I make
Every breath I take
I'll make it up to you

Sweet Cherry Wine,tommy james ,1969,1960,"(Come on)
Everyone, we got to get together, now
Oh, yeah, love's the only thing that matters anyhow
And the beauty of life can only survive
If we love one another
Oh, yeah, yesterday my friends were marching out to war
Oh, yeah, listen, now, we ain't a-marching anymore
No, we ain't going to fight, only God has the right
To decide who's to live and die

He gave us sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
(All day and night)
And everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine
Yes, they will

Watch the mountain turn to dust and blow away
Oh, Lord, you know there's got to be a better way
And the old masquerade is a no soul parade
Marching through the ruins of time

To save us, he gave us
Sweet cherry wine, so very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
Everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine

Oh, sweet cherry wine
So very fine

An Old Fashioned Love Song,three dog night,1972,1970,"Just an old-fashioned love song
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go

You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
(Just an old-fashioned love song)
(Comin' down in three-part harmony)

To weave our dreams upon and listen
To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings
That we've come to know

You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on and...
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

(Just an old-fashioned love song)

Crack A Bottle,"eminem, dr. dre ",2009,2000,"Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Okay, let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

Tainted Love,soft cell,1982,1980,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love"
Redneck Stomp,jeff foxworthy,1995,1990,"If you've ever been on television more than 5 times
Describing what the tornadoes sounded like...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever cut your grass and found a car...
You might be a redneck
If your dad walks you to school because your in the same grade...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever been too drunk to fish...
If somebody asks to see your ID and you show them your belt buckle..
If every day somebody comes to your house mistakenly thinking your having a
Yard sale
If you've ever had to haul a can of paint to the top of a water tower to defend
Your sister's honor..
You might be a redneck
If your dog and your wallet are both on a chain...
You might be a redneck
They always make fun of the way I talk, I keep telling them I said your gonna be
Real surprised when you get into the habit in St. Petersburg and say
""Y'all get into the truck, we goin up to the big house.""
If you've ever financed a tattoo....
If you've ever made change in the offering plate...
You might be a redneck
We have words in the south they don't have in other parts of the country..
Now, you come to the south, we have words like...yu'nt to
We goin to the mall, yu'nt to?
What letter does that start with, does anybody know?
I like this word alot...aight
That's a word in Texas...aight
Round lunch time every day, you'll hear somebody say
""hey jeet yet, naw, dju? Yu'nt to? Aight.""
If you go to the family reunion to meet women....
If you smoked during your wedding....
You might be a redneck
And last but not least
If you see a sign that says say no to crack
And it reminds you to pull your jeans up...
You might be a redneck"
Along Came Jones,the coasters,1959,1950,"I flopped down in my easy chair and turned on channel 2
A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was a-chasin' poor sweet Sue
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh
""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'll saw you all in half""
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He turned on the buzz saw (And then? And then?)
Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall, thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones
Commercial came on, so I got up to get myself a snack
You should've seen what was going on by the time that I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine, sweet Sue was a-havin' fits
That villain said, ""Give me the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits""
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (And then? And then?)
Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall, thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones
I got so bugged, I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was a-tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said, ""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track""
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He threw her on the railroad track (And then?)

Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me

So many things you should have known

When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss

Red lips kissin away my fears
A blue kiss bringin me back to tears
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
Yea, these kisses are blue
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
A prism of love surrounded us
Don't you see what our hearts knew
How can you chose a one-color world
When you know that I've got a rainbow for you
Last night a spectrum filled the sky
This morning it shattered with your goodbye
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss

Soul Food,goodie mob,1996,1990,"My old boy from the point
But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't got no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
I'm ready to begin
Another chance to get further away from where I've been
But I'll never forget
Everythang I went through I appreciate the shit
Because If I hada went and took the easy way
Wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food

Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetti plus her monthly flow

They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had a lot, but thankful for
The little that I got
Why not be?
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at Tha Beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food"
She Got The Goldmine (i Got The Shaft),jerry reed,1982,1980,"Well, I guess it was back in '63
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife
Well, she said she would, so I said, ""I do""
But I'da said ""I wouldn't"" if I'da just knew
How sayin' ""I do"" was gonna screw up all of my life
Well, the first few years weren't all that bad
I'll never forget the good times we had
'Cause I'm reminded every month
When I send her the child support
Well, it wasn't too long 'til the lust all died
And I'll admit, I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said
""Goodbye, turkey, my attorney will be in touch,"" mhm
So I decided right then and there
I was gonna do what's right, give 'er her fair share
But brother, I didn't know her share was gonna be that much

She got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it right down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, it all sounds sorta funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

Now listen, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Why, they give her the color television set
Then they give her the house
The kids and both of the cars
See?
Well, then they start talkin' about child support
Alimony, and the costs to the court
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes
Besides, everything I ever had worth takin' they've already took
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney
Askin' myself, ""Why didn't you just learn how to cook?""

They give her the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
They give me the shaft (I got the shaft)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle
But she got the better half
Well, it all sounds mighty funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft


Well, she got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it all down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, I guess it all sounds funny (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ha-ha-ha)
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

Heh, heh, they ain't kidding, I got the shaft (Ooh)
But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore (Ooh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I let my wife tote it, I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps (Ooh)
You get it judge?
I'm gonna be indebted (Ooh)
That's not funny, huh?
Huh?
Contempt of court? (Ooh)
What do you mean I'm–
Listen judge, I'm just kiddin' (Ooh)
I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip, can ya? (Ha-ha-ha)"
Blaze Of Glory,kenny rogers,1982,1980,"Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Here we are, broken-hearted
We thought our love would never end
We fell hard when we got started
Fallin' out like we fell in

Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Let's don't lie and hurt each other
That would be our worst mistake
Once again let's act like lovers
One more time for old-time's sake

Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory
Let's go out (let's go out)
In a blaze of glory (in a blaze of glory)
All good things must end
Like two heroes (ah) in a story (in a story)
Let's go out (let's go out) like we came in (like we came in)
In a blaze of glory"
Stay Real,erick sermon,1993,1990,"It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin'
Flexin no half steppin
When I release the funky weapon
Like Ricochet ping ping ping
I make fans fell it even when I sing
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berenger in Platoon
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
Whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
Who ain't down with the format
When you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
That's wack
You trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee
And then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
And then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
You lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in
From the Smith and Wessons
Change the out look
Change the cover of the book
You hip hop crook and give back what you took
It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya
Boy stay real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

It's on again, yeah, about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend, just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music
The fronting, you can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not, I could kill you man
For being false, plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous
Because I've been here since Strictly Business
The era of Eric B. and Rakim, Biz
Public Enemy, Run-DMC, Whodini
The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
LL, when he was rockin bells
Sucker, which fake emcee is rearranging the structure
Ban the motherfucker
And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind
So stay real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

Yes, I'm back, Black, for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of an MC hardcore style type of human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know? Because MTV shows it
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots, the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees
And wannabes that's worst than the AIDS disease
So wake up like a Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead, get to the point (word 'em up)
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom!
Peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic
The only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

Peace, and I;m outta here

So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear

I was waiting for a sign from you
Hoping you'd feel the same way too
When you looked at me and smiled
My heart was going a thousand miles
I stopped, turned around
I tried to keep my feet of the ground
As I stepped to you we touched
I knew you were feeling it too because

Am I Wrong,love spit love,1994,1990,"There's too much
That I keep to myself
And I turn my back on my faith
It's like glass
When we break
I wish no one in my place

And I've seen
You don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep

I can't stay
In this place
I can't stand
When the room turns round
On my fate
You give no guarantees
There's no promise
I can keep
I can't stand
I can't see my way
I feel blind
On my feet
I can't stay too long
Am I wrong?
 (x6)
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck

I'm so tired
Of my mood
And sleep comes
With a knife, fork and a spoon
You're so pale
In your face
You let life
Get in your way

Am I wrong?

Goodbye, lay the blame on luck"

Every minute we're apart
Darlin' I've been livin'
For the moment that we touch
So I can cover you in kisses
And wrap you in my love
Baby keep that fire burnin'
Pour a glass of that sweet wine
Let your hair down on your shoulders
And I'll be there just in time
To cover you in kisses
Hold you in my arms

Ant B-Z what up man?

Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday
1 - Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way

We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Got some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never
Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days
Repeat 2

Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks

Polk Salad Annie,tony joe white,1969,1960,"If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
Cause that's about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean, vicious woman)
Every day 'for suppertime, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman)
(Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)
Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(Sock a little polk salad to me
You know I need me a mess of it)"

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone

Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone

Alone At Last,jackie wilson,1960,1960,"Alone at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low;
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one;
The trip to heavens begun;
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when were
All alone at last
Oh, my darling, at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low;
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one;
The trip to heavens begun;
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when were
All alone at last"
Cast Your Fate To The Wind,sounds orchestral,1965,1960,"A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail when the tide comes in
I just cast my fate to the wind
I shift my course along the breeze
Won't sail upwind on memories
The empty sky is my best friend
I just cast my fate to the wind
A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail when the tide comes in
I just cast my fate to the wind"
Teen Age Idol,rick nelson,1962,1960,"Some people call me a teenage idol
Some people say they envy me
I guess they got no way of knowing
How lonesome I can be
I need somebody to be my baby
Someone to tell my troubles to
I got no time to ever find her
'Cause I'm just passing through
I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone
I got no rest when I'm feeling weary
I got to pack my bags and go
I got to be somewhere tomorrow
To smile and do my show
I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone
Some people call me a teenage idol
Some people say they envy me
I guess they got no way of knowing
How lonesome I can be
How lonesome I can be"

Will I ever be the same?

When you see me smile
You know
Things are just gettin' worse
Any smile you might see, baby
Has all been rehearsed

Baby, I can't go on without you
This loneliness won't let me live without you
This emptiness inside me, baby
Makes me feel half alive

To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me


Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?"

It was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day
I felt fine
Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said theyre leaving
And now I'm torn all apart
I think I'll never forget that day
And for you, girl
This is all I have to say
Ooh, la la

Me, myself and I
You were my girl

And now it don't seem so very nice
Forever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down
You kept me on my feet

(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Will I ever be the same
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Oh yeah
(Baby, baby,) When you see me smiling, you know
(I need you and I want you, baby.)
Things have gotten worse.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Any smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Has all been rehearsed.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Darling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
This emptiness won't let me live without you
(And I need you and I love you, baby.)
This loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Makes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving"
Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely,backstreet boys,2000,2000,"Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart (heart!)

There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart
(You are missing from my heart)
Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart"
24/7,kevon edmonds,2000,2000,"Baby it's no mystery
You're bringing out the best in me
And though I've been in love before
I've never had the kind of love that made me feel secure
I never thought that give and take
Mentality was right for me, mmm
You made me open up and see
That it's for real
And there's no other place I'd rather be
CHORUS:
Think about you all the time
24-7 babe
The love I have inside for you
Is more than any words can say
Pray to God on bended knee
We'll always be together babe
You and me
If there's a high or low
Anything can be babe
I'll be there for you
Pick you up off your feet, yeah
Pray to God on bended knee
We'll always be together babe
You and me
When I'm in my nine to five
I smile across my lips when I
Daydream about the night before
I count the minutes till I'm in your arms once more
My friends they don't understand, no
In me they see a brand new man
I give you props and tell them that
My shorty's bout it
She personifies the love she gives
CHORUS
Oh how I've waited for this moment in my life
It's you that I adore
Baby with you I am secure
My life is in your hands
And now I understand
What it means to be in love again, oh
Never gonna let u go, oh no
Chorus until end"

"Bad Boys (Theme From ""Cops"")",inner circle,1993,1990,"As days go by in a rush
You've forgotten why you exist
And you are unaware of the problems
You've caused
You want to laugh
You want to have fun
Life is tough as is
That's why
You want music to entertain you
To whisk you away from reality
But we believe that music can bring about change
Come with us
Shall we begin?
 (Nature)
At the time of Genghis Khan the price of washin' your hands in a river was death
We migrated and decayed spewing trash we've ended up fuckin' up our three seas
The unpredictable ruffian he breathes exhaust gas and he's now having a barbecue!
Forests on fire
Mother Nature weeping blood
Arrogance at an all time high!
Factory chimneys belch smoke
Nuclear reactors, hazardous waste
""Electro smoke"" is always on the go
The biggest parasite is man just look at the planet!
Man isn't even as capable as animals
He changed things up, then couldn't adapt
The bill is for the next generation to pay
Doomsday's upon us, watch like an imbecile!
 (Drought)
Don't do it!
Don't toss cigarette butts in the sea
You can't take it back
There'll come a day when that trash-filled sea
Will be missed, but it won't be there!
Not long before we go barren like Africa
Children growing up without water
Because we destroyed our lakes, rivers, streams, everything!
No mercy?
I can't believe it
We've taken it all for granted
Animals have their stomachs filled with plastic
Doesn't it break your heart?
Retweeting isn't enough
Something must be done
Do not pollute the water!
Let my land be serene like water
Don't inject no poison into its veins!

Come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notice
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
Don't be afraid come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notic
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
 (Law)
I am a ""White Turk""
My laws are Anglo-Saxon but my mind is Middle-Eastern
I grew up apolitical
I never voted
I've cared about holidays, traveling and debts
Justice is dead
I stayed silent and participated until it was me
Now I'm too scared to send a tweet
I've come to fear my own country's police
Sorry to say, but this hopeless generation is your creation
The unhappy faction is your creation and this gunfire!
Innocent men rotting in jail without even knowing why
It's all you!
This horrifying picture is your creation this tired voice of mine
Idiot MPs, corrupt leeches, building their wealth on the back of the poor, using their taxes
It's all you!
You've never encountered death, never once lost your breath
A coffee expert, always a cup in your hand
All you care about is your wannabe ""Startup""
Now, the justice that was supposed to protect you will come knocking, will break down your door!
You've acquitted child-killers just because they are cops you didn't say a word, which means you're guilty!
Because you mourned for two days, and moved on
You forgot the name of the judge
Who released Tugce and Busra's killers!
If something happens to you, will you rely on the law?
If they falsely arrest you one night, no single journalist can report it because they're all locked up!
The lives taken by released killers (They won't come back)
Wasted years in prison on a false charge (They won't come back)
You stayed silent
You were overpowered because you were quiet
They took away your rights and they won't give them back voluntarily!
 (Justice)
Justice is supposedly the pillar of a country
It's turned a deaf ear, won't listen to you
Traditions, morals, customs
If the one before was bad, tell me, is the incumbent any better?
Is this civilized?
We can't even afford what your dog won't eat
Your police can't pull out his gun and shoot whoever he wants in broad daylight!
Media, press, law, military they all work for you
Young boys are out there at the crack of dawn putting their lives on the line
Hate is your weapon!
These aren't even our sins to pay for
Your plan is all nice!
I don't know who buys this
But I do know this
Our weapon are our words!
 (Law)
I'm the voice of the lost generation
I can't be censored in a flawed picture
To get my team out of this grave I always slept with one eye open
Sticks, knives, they're all ineffective!
A sharp mind is my prime objective
As patience devoured my brain the ones who rained down on me, I set aflame!
All I did was make music!
The police took offense and took me in
I'm at another hearing while you go to your gig
Wearing the same old suit for the past ten years
The day someone tells me all is not for nothing will be the day I'll give my heart and my soul
The judiciary comes and collects its dues
In hell I'm living, my body is burning
 (Turkey)
Hello Turkey (3B)
I have an ID (T.C.)
We're trying to get by without getting in harm's way
The charlatan on TV, always a fanatic devotee!
Maliciousness is an epidemic, continues to manipulate!
This is all a charade!
We're flying into turbulence!
Syria was our neighbor, now are they our citizens? (Fellow countrymen?)
Even the dead aren't at peace, we're cursed by them
""Hurriyet"" was just a newspaper
You go be as free as you can be!
 (Istanbul)
Swallows us whole in a single bite
All-devouring Istanbul!
Chipping away at the best of times
It's an elusive mystery!
Its streets are paved with gold
You gave your hand, it grabbed your arm (get 'em!)
Transport, education, judiciary (help!)
The devil's spread his poison!
Money is a must or having contacts is a must
The big guys having your number is a must
Having an insider in Aksaray is a must
We never owned a yacht, a flat or a mansion
Our piggy banks were never full
I wasn't born rich
You must have a purpose in the big city
You didn't produce anything, yet you burned down forests!
You've become an animal in the concrete jungle
You've got dark circles under your eyes again
Dinosaurs are in power
There's a role for everyone in this jungle
""Stay silent and you will be next""
""Bright minds are facing a dark future next!""
 (Education)
I will graduate!
I'll give you cash, you give me a diploma
No money, I must work up a sweat
Equal opportunity in education is what I exploit as a college student
I graduated
I'm a drifter because of the system you created
I graduated
I'll be a cashier or I'll be your usher at the movies!
Universities everywhere but village schools are in dire need
Whatever ideology the higher-ups have is what is taught in class
Rich, poor separated favored according to their money or backing
Education is an industry the same as making illegal profit from construction!
One doesn't have money for books
A budding teacher who doesn't know ""the right people""
You know an MP? Wow!
You'll never get me if that's how you roll!
At least help out a village school
Chaos everywhere
You should fight too!
The kid barely slept tonight
He will go to school build him a road!
 (Curiosity)
Why this sky?
These stars, these galaxies, the planets...
Why?
What makes this universe?
What makes the Earth?
Why me? Why you? Why us? Ask!
First of all, ask ""Why do I exist?
""Where did I come from and why am I human?
How did I? How did we? How does everything?
How did we add meaning? How do we learn?
What does life favor? Who gets the grace?
""Who gets to eat?""
To understand, to explain and comprehend?
Is it forbidden to understand?
Could be, but there isn't one answer!
There are many, go seek them out!
Chase it, make sure to look for proof!
Feed your soul, keep looking for fuel!
Protect your heart and find a witness
Take a breath and pursue art!
Ask, ask about the atoms
Think of the speed of light and go get yourself wings
And then... Fly!
Fly as high as you can!
Fly as high as you can fly!
Let yourself go!
 (Women's Rights)
I wouldn't know
I've never had to defend myself
I wouldn't know, I've never had to worry about a child
I've never been forced to marry
There was no abuse in my home
In my own home I've never been imprisoned in my room
I've never been indoctrinated
I've never been displaced
I've never been burned with hatred
I was never burned to death
I never had siblings
I've never been afraid of my older brother
I've never been pulled out of school
I've never been murdered!
 (Violence Against Women)
You never lay your hands on a woman, you idiot!
You're a sorry excuse for a human being!
She deserves the best
Say ""No to violence against women!""
Why are the males at the top of the pyramid?
In traffic, at home or in public transportation?
The harassments never end
A slap on the wrist doesn't cut it
Uh, ah, are these moneybags your idea of a ""Man""?
Slapped her five times in Beşiktaş, nasty
Pockets full of money, heart worthless
Where's your head at? Are you even human?
Secondhand embarrassment! Are you even human?
Are you even human?
How do you even get to this point? How?
 (World)
Let this world spin like my head is spinning
As I lose my mind
A dream
My breath, my inner voice
I fall into the deep
Let this world spin like my head is spinning
As I lose my mind
A dream
My breath, my inner voice
I fall into the deep
 (Foreign Lands)
They banged my head against a wall
They put out cigarettes on my skin instead of protecting me
They made me get up
The smell of burnt skin and smoke
Bastinado, ""motherfucker""
Is that the due process here?
According to which rule?
I'm ready for battle, there will be chaos
This is what is taught, loving violence and fanning the flames
Germany is as cold as ice, let me tell you
Most of the youth are on Amphetamines Tilidine"" or ""Weed"", ""Cocaine"" or ""Speed"", ""Crack""
You might like it but it's not my cup of tea
Not my cup of tea!
Walk as you please! Step on a mine and die
And for what cost?
How much is it?
Stop rolling around like a wheel
Just be my friend
If you're talking, be honest!
 (Animal Rights)
A bowl of water, is that too much to ask?
Have a conscience, damn it!
You don't want to understand but their lives are entrusted to you and me
Think for once!
""You're living alone, outside, in the cold, in winter
Nobody speaks your language
Danger everywhere
Always disaster, always calamity!""
They can't win, they are the wounded
Whatever they do, it's never enough for you
It's about compassion, not money!
Abandoning them in the woods is not the answer!
They're not wolves, they can't survive on their own there
Protect them
They can't fight for their own rights
The shelters are full
The territory is harsh
Its sky is dark
The punishment is money for raping and torturing stray animals
""Major immorality requires major imbeciles""
Not all humans are guilty but all animals are innocent!

Come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notic
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
Don't be afraid come
There will come a day
When these guilty words will be imprisoned
Defeated I'll disappear they won't notic
I won't stay silent
I can't stay silent
 (Suicide)
Don't go! (Don't go)
There's still a lot we can change in this life
Don't be stubborn!
We all gave up at some point in time
Now clench your fist
Put an end to your silence
Remember how strong you stood when you blew a fuse!
Hate inside, hate outside
Come!
Love life the most
I can't create a world for you but I will definitely hold your hand
Don't leave the world even if everyone leaves you
I'm not judging you
I will never fully understand your pain
I know
If it's too heavy, I leave it behind I walk down my own path
Please look at the mirror say ""I love you""
 (Fascism)
Ey! What is fascism?
To put it roughly, we will be deceived
All of us, together
All you know is ""you""
Many accidents caused by overambition
This ambition is an everlasting emotion
Snap at your wife at home
Crisis on the street
Shh!
Kick a dog, not the purebred, but the mutt, brainless!
Ey! A thief who steals from himself
Fear the police, ey!
The ""System"" wants you to be a nobody, a raw, and shallow, individual
Know what is what and know us
We're the generation that looks dirty but has clean hands
You are the seat of the bike while we are the wheels and the handlebars
Ey! Naturally, we want a generation like ours
Ey! This is our main goal, respect is all
Grandchild, be a mirror!
Anxiety galore but this is our road
Drown or be born
So many wrongs, as many rights
So be it, grandchild
Respect is all!
 (Street)
I can't look you in the eyes, my face falls
Barefoot but dreams in their eyes
Timid but he still puts in the work
He's spent
Look! Every day is an exile!
He can't escape, bullies chase him
They look for a helping hand
Burn the big shot's money and go knock that fuckin' ego out
Don't name streets after ministers, but after the poor and the orphans
Don't interfere with the street vendors, send the officers to the skyscrapers

I'm a branch broken off by the storm
Been around a lot and fraying
So much goes on inside me
There are no words if I tried to explain
Sometimes I'm the story of a homeless child
I'm a branch broken off by the storm
Been around a lot and fraying
So much goes on inside me
There are no words if I tried to explain
Sometimes I'm the story of a homeless child
 (Traffic)
A death trap
Highways are death traps
365 days at risk
Countless ruffians with no conscience
Pay hush money
A car accident overshadow the holidays
Broken hearts, so much pain
A requiem rings in their ears, the wound never heals
Alcohol, violence, and speed cause terror
Kids driving expensive sports cars have no fear
Safety first, leniency next
Patience, peace, man needs these
The smallest of mistakes can ruin everything
Believe me, there's no return!"

Set The Night To Music,roberta flack ,1991,1990,"Set the night to music
Set the night to music
Look at all the stars tonight, look at all the moonlight
Look at us we're all alone
Oh and it's just like a dream, some romantic fantasy
Darling come and hold, hold me close
We could be making love
And with the slightest touch
We could, set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music
Find a rhythm all our own, melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here
Your heart beating next to mine, perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world disappear

Can I Change My Mind,tyrone davis,1969,1960,"Aww, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl
She fooled me this time
She acted like I was
The last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind
As I took those steps
Toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would
Make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind
Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
But, ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep looking back but
My baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind"
Cat's In The Cradle,ugly kid joe,1993,1990,"My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""
""I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
""You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah""
""You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""
""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover,sophie b. hawkins,1992,1990,"That old dog has chained you up all right
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you
Come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good
Don't say you'll stay
'Cause then you go away

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks
For me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever

I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks
For me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

Open up, I wanna gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
Damn I wish I was your lover
Gettin' on a subway
And I'm comin' uptown
Damn I wish I was your lover
Standin' on a street corner
Waitin' for my luck to change
Damn I wish I was your lover
Feelin' like a schoolboy
Too shy and too young, ohh
Damn I wish I was your lover
Open up, I wanna gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
Damn I wish I was your lover
Gettin' on my camel
Gonna ride it uptown, oooh
Damn I wish I was your lover
Hangin' around this jungle"
Patches,clarence carter,1970,1970,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule
So every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through
'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""
Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
I could still hear papa when he's saying:
""Patches, I'm depending on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you"""

When I used to play shoot 'em up

She's A Fool,lesley gore,1963,1960,"She dunno that she's a lucky girl
Got the best thing in the whole wide world
Got a love that's hard to find
But the boy I wish was mine

She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel

He dunno it but she cheats on him
With a boy like that, it's such a sin
I would never be untrue
I would never make him blue


I know there's gonna come a day
He will tell the girl, 'Be on your way,'
Maybe then he'll turn to me
Then how happy I will be that"
Paper Roses,anita bryant,1960,1960,"I realize the way your eyes deceived me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of
Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

Behind These Hazel Eyes,kelly clarkson,2005,2000,"Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside

"The ""In"" Crowd",ramsey lewis trio,1965,1960,"20 U.S. 123 (1908)
MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.We recognize and appreciate to the fullest extent the very great importance of this case, not only to the parties now before the court, but also to the great mass of the citizens of this country, all of whom are interested in the practical working of the courts of justice throughout the land, both Federal and state, and in the proper exercise of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, as limited and controlled by the Federal Constitution and the laws of Congress.
That there has been room for difference of opinion with regard to such limitations the reported cases in this court bear conclusive testimony. It cannot be stated that the case before us is entirely free from any possible doubt nor that intelligent men may not differ as to the correct answer to the question we are called upon to decide.
The question of jurisdiction, whether of the Circuit Court or of this court, is frequently a delicate matter to deal with, and it is especially so in this case, where the material and most important objection to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is the assertion that the suit is in effect against one of the States of the Union. It is a question, however, which we are called upon, and which it is our duty, to decide. Under these circumstances, the language of Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404, is most apposite. In that case he said:
*143 ""It is most true that this court will not take jurisdiction if it should not; but it is equally true that it must take jurisdiction if it should. The judiciary cannot, as the legislature may, avoid a measure because it approaches the confines of the Constitution. We cannot pass it by because it is doubtful. With whatever doubts, with whatever difficulties, a case may be attended, we must decide it, if it be brought before us. We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be treason to the Constitution. Questions may occur which we would gladly avoid, but we cannot avoid them. All we can do is to exercise our best judgment, and conscientiously perform our duty.""
Coming to a consideration of the case, we find that the complainants in the suit commenced in the Circuit Court were stockholders in the Northern Pacific Railway Company, and the reason for commencing it and making the railroad company one of the parties defendant is sufficiently set forth in the bill. Davis &c. Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U.S. 207, 220; Equity Rule 94, Supreme Court.
It is primarily asserted on the part of the petitioner that jurisdiction did not exist in the Circuit Court because there was not the requisite diversity of citizenship, and there was no question arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States to otherwise give jurisdiction to that court. There is no claim made here of jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, and the claim, if made, would be unfounded in fact. If no other ground exists, then the order of the Circuit Court, assuming to punish petitioner for contempt, was an unlawful order, made by a court without jurisdiction. In such case this court, upon proper application, will discharge the person from imprisonment. Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651; Ex parte Fisk, 113 U.S. 713; In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 485. But an examination of the record before us shows that there are Federal questions in this case.
It is insisted by the petitioner that there is no Federal question *144 presented under the Fourteenth Amendment, because there is no dispute as to the meaning of the Constitution, where it provides that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, and whatever dispute there may be in this case is one of fact simply, whether the freight or passenger rates as fixed by the legislature or by the railroad commission are so low as to be confiscatory, and that is not a Federal question.
Jurisdiction is given to the Circuit Court in suits involving the requisite amount, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States (1 U.S. Comp. Stat. p. 508), and the question really to be determined under this objection is whether the acts of the legislature and the orders of the railroad commission, if enforced, would take property without due process of law, and although that question might incidentally involve a question of fact, its solution nevertheless is one which raises a Federal question. See Hastings v. Ames (C.C.A. 8th Circuit), 68 Fed. Rep. 726. The sufficiency of rates with reference to the Federal Constitution is a judicial question, and one over which Federal courts have jurisdiction by reason of its Federal nature. Chicago &c. R.R. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U.S. 418; Reagan v. Farmers' &c. Co., 154 U.S. 369, 399; St. Louis &c. Co. v. Gill, 156 U.S. 649; Covington &c. Turnpike Road Company v. Sandford, 164 U.S. 578; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S. 466, 522; Chicago &c. Railway Co. v. Tompkins, 176 U.S. 167, 172.
Another Federal question is the alleged unconstitutionality of these acts because of the enormous penalties denounced for their violation, which prevent the railway company, as alleged, or any of its servants or employes, from resorting to the courts for the purpose of determining the validity of such acts. The contention is urged by the complainants in the suit that the company is denied the equal protection of the laws and its property is liable to be taken without due process of law, because it is only allowed a hearing upon the claim of *145 the unconstitutionality of the acts and orders in question, at the risk, if mistaken, of being subjected to such enormous penalties, resulting in the possible confiscation of its whole property, that rather than take such risks the company would obey the laws, although such obedience might also result in the end (though by a slower process) in such confiscation.
Still another Federal question is urged, growing out of the assertion that the laws are, by their necessary effect, an interference with and a regulation of interstate commerce, the grounds for which assertion it is not now necessary to enlarge upon. The question is not, at any rate, frivolous.
We conclude that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction in the case before it, because it involved the decision of Federal questions arising under the Constitution of the United States.
Coming to the inquiry regarding the alleged invalidity of these acts, we take up the contention that they are invalid on their face on account of the penalties. For disobedience to the freight act the officers, directors, agents and employes of the company are made guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction each may be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not exceeding ninety days. Each violation would be a separate offense, and, therefore, might result in imprisonment of the various agents of the company who would dare disobey for a term of ninety days each for each offense. Disobedience to the passenger rate act renders the party guilty of a felony and subject to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or imprisonment in the state prison for a period not exceeding five years, or both fine and imprisonment. The sale of each ticket above the price permitted by the act would be a violation thereof. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the company to obtain officers, agents or employes willing to carry on its affairs except in obedience to the act and orders in question. The company itself would also, in case of disobedience, be liable to the immense fines provided for in violating orders of the Commission. The company, in order to test the validity of the acts, must find some *146 agent or employe to disobey them at the risk stated. The necessary effect and result of such legislation must be to preclude a resort to the courts (either state or Federal) for the purpose of testing its validity. The officers and employes could not be expected to disobey any of the provisions of the acts or orders at the risk of such fines and penalties being imposed upon them, in case the court should decide that the law was valid. The result would be a denial of any hearing to the company. The observations upon a similar question made by Mr. Justice Brewer in Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Company, 183 U.S. 79, 99, 100, 102, are very apt. At page 100 he stated: ""Do the laws secure to an individual an equal protection when he is allowed to come into court and make his claim or defense subject to the condition that upon a failure to make good that claim or defense the penalty for such failure either appropriates all his property or subjects him to extravagant and unreasonable loss?"" Again, at page 102, he says: ""It is doubtless true that the State may impose penalties, such as will tend to compel obedience to its mandates by all, individuals or corporations, and if extreme and cumulative penalties are imposed only after there has been a final determination of the validity of the statute, the question would be very different from that here presented. But when the legislature, in an effort to prevent any inquiry of the validity of a particular statute, so burdens any challenge thereof in the courts that the party affected is necessarily constrained to submit rather than take the chances of the penalties imposed, then it becomes a serious question whether the party is not deprived of the equal protection of the laws."" The question was not decided in that case, as it went off on another ground. We have the same question now before us, only the penalties are more severe in the way of fines, to which is added, in the case of officers, agents or employee of the company, the risk of imprisonment for years as a common felon. See also Mercantile Trust Co. v. Texas &c. Ry. Co., 51 Fed. Rep. 529, 543; Louisville &c. R.R. Co. v. McChord, 103 *147 Fed. Rep. 216, 223; Consolidated Gas Co. v. Mayer, 146 Fed. Rep. 150, 153. In McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U.S. 662, 694, it was held that to provide a different remedy to enforce a contract, which is unreasonable, and which imposes conditions not existing when the contract was made, was to offer no remedy, and when the remedy is so onerous and impracticable as to substantially give none at all the law is invalid, although what is termed a remedy is in fact given. See also Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 317; Seibert v. Lewis, 122 U.S. 284. If the law be such as to make the decision of the legislature or of a commission conclusive as to the sufficiency of the rates, this court has held such a law to be unconstitutional. Chicago &c. Railway Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U.S. 418. A law which indirectly accomplishes a like result by imposing such conditions upon the right to appeal for judicial relief as works an abandonment of the right rather than face the conditions upon which it is offered or may be obtained, is also unconstitutional. It may therefore be said that when the penalties for disobedience are by fines so enormous and imprisonment so severe as to intimidate the company and its officers from resorting to the courts to test the validity of the legislation, the result is the same as if the law in terms prohibited the company from seeking judicial construction of laws which deeply affect its rights.
It is urged that there is no principle upon which to base the claim that a person is entitled to disobey a statute at least once, for the purpose of testing its validity without subjecting himself to the penalties for disobedience provided by the statute in case it is valid. This is not an accurate statement of the case. Ordinarily a law creating offenses in the nature of misdemeanors or felonies relates to a subject over which the jurisdiction of the legislature is complete in any event. In the case, however, of the establishment of certain rates without any hearing, the validity of such rates necessarily depends upon whether they are high enough to permit at least some return upon the investment (how much it is not now *148 necessary to state), and an inquiry as to that fact is a proper subject of judicial investigation. If it turns out that the rates are too low for that purpose, then they are illegal. Now, to impose upon a party interested the burden of obtaining a judicial decision of such a question (no prior hearing having ever been given) only upon the condition that if unsuccessful he must suffer imprisonment and pay fines as provided in these acts, is, in effect, to close up all approaches to the courts, and thus prevent any hearing upon the question whether the rates as provided by the acts are not too low, and therefore invalid. The distinction is obvious between a case where the validity of the act depends upon the existence of a fact which can be determined only after investigation of a very complicated and technical character, and the ordinary case of a statute upon a subject requiring no such investigation and over which the jurisdiction of the legislature is complete in any event.
We hold, therefore, that the provisions of the acts relating to the enforcement of the rates, either for freight or passengers, by imposing such enormous fines and possible imprisonment as a result of an unsuccessful effort to test the validity of the laws themselves, are unconstitutional on their face, without regard to the question of the insufficiency of those rates. We also hold that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction under the cases already cited (and it was therefore its duty) to inquire whether the rates permitted by these acts or orders were too low and therefore confiscatory, and if so held, that the court then had jurisdiction to permanently enjoin the railroad company from putting them in force, and that it also had power, while the inquiry was pending, to grant a temporary injunction to the same effect.
Various affidavits were received upon the hearing before the court prior to the granting of the temporary injunction, and the hearing itself was, as appears from the opinion, full and deliberate, and the fact was found that the rates fixed by the commodity act, under the circumstances existing with *149 reference to the passenger rate act and the orders of the Commission, were not sufficient to be compensatory, and were in fact confiscatory, and the act was therefore unconstitutional. The injunction was thereupon granted with reference to the enforcement of the commodity act.
We have, therefore, upon this record the case of an unconstitutional act of the state legislature and an intention by the Attorney General of the State to endeavor to enforce its provisions, to the injury of the company, in compelling it, at great expense, to defend legal proceedings of a complicated and unusual character, and involving questions of vast importance to all employes and officers of the company, as well as to the company itself. The question that arises is whether there is a remedy that the parties interested may resort to, by going into a Federal court of equity, in a case involving a violation of the Federal Constitution, and obtaining a judicial investigation of the problem, and pending its solution obtain freedom from suits, civil or criminal, by a temporary injunction, and if the question be finally decided favorably to the contention of the company, a permanent injunction restraining all such actions or proceedings.
This inquiry necessitates an examination of the most material and important objection made to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the objection being that the suit is, in effect, one against the State of Minnesota, and that the injunction issued against the Attorney General illegally prohibits state action, either criminal or civil, to enforce obedience to the statutes of the State. This objection is to be considered with reference to the Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. The Eleventh Amendment prohibits the commencement or prosecution of any suit against one of the United States by citizens of another State or citizens or subjects of any foreign State. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall it deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
*150 The case before the Circuit Court proceeded upon the theory that the orders and acts heretofore mentioned would, if enforced, violate rights of the complainants protected by the latter Amendment. We think that whatever the rights of complainants may be, they are largely founded upon that Amendment, but a decision of this case does not require an examination or decision of the question whether its adoption in any way altered or limited the effect of the earlier Amendment. We may assume that each exists in full force, and that we must give to the Eleventh Amendment all the effect it naturally would have, without cutting it down or rendering its meaning any more narrow than the language, fairly interpreted, would warrant. It applies to a suit brought against a State by one of its own citizens as well as to a suit brought by a citizen of another State. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1. It was adopted after the decision of this court in Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), 2 Dall. 419 where it was held that a State might be sued by a citizen of another State. Since that time there have been many cases decided in this court involving the Eleventh Amendment, among them being Osborn v. United States Bank (1824), 9 Wheat. 738, 846, 857, which held that the Amendment applied only to those suits in which the State was a party on the record. In the subsequent case of Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo (1828), 1 Pet. 110, 122, 123, that holding was somewhat enlarged, and Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, while citing Osborn v. United States Bank, supra, said that where the claim was made, as in the case then before the court, against the Governor of Georgia as governor, and the demand was made upon him, not personally, but officially (for moneys in the treasury of the State and for slaves in possession of the state government), the State might be considered as the party on the record (page 123), and therefore the suit could not be maintained.
Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 220, reiterates the rule of Osborn v. United States Bank, so far as concerns the right to enjoin a state officer from executing a state law in conflict with *151 the Constitution or a statute of the United States, when such execution will violate the rights of the complainant.
In Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U.S. 270, 296 (Poindexter v. Greenhow), it was adjudged that a suit against a tax collector who had refused coupons in payment of taxes, and, under color of a void law, was about to seize and sell the property of a taxpayer for non-payment of his taxes, was a suit against him personally as a wrongdoer and not against the State.
Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52, 67, decided that the bill was in substance a bill for the specific performance of a contract between the complainants and the State of South Carolina, and, although the State was not in name made a party defendant, yet being the actual party to the alleged contract the performance of which was sought and the only party by whom it could be performed, the State was, in effect, a party to the suit, and it could not be maintained for that reason. The things required to be done by the actual defendants were the very things which when done would constitute a performance of the alleged contract by the State.
The cases upon the subject were reviewed, and it was held, In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, that a bill in equity brought against officers of a State, who, as individuals, have no personal interest in the subject-matter of the suit, and defend only as representing the State, where the relief prayed for, if done, would constitute a performance by the State of the alleged contract of the State, was a suit against the State (page 504), following in this respect Hagood v. Southern, supra.
A suit of such a nature was simply an attempt to make the State itself, through its officers, perform its alleged contract, by directing those officers to do acts which constituted such performance. The State alone had any interest in the question, and a decree in favor of plaintiff would affect the treasury of the State.
On the other hand, United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, determined that an individual in possession of real estate under the Government of the United States, which claimed to be *152 its owner, was, nevertheless, properly sued by the plaintiff, as owner, to recover possession, and such suit was not one against the United States, although the individual in possession justified such possession under its authority. See also Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204, to the same effect.
In Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1, 9, a suit against land commissioners of the State was said not to be against the State, although the complainants sought to restrain the defendants, officials of the State, from violating, under an unconstitutional act, the complainants' contract with the State, and thereby working irreparable damage to the property rights of the complainants. Osborn v. United States Bank, supra, was cited, and it was stated: ""But the general doctrine of Osborn v. Bank of the United States, that the Circuit Courts of the United States will restrain a state officer from executing an unconstitutional statute of the State, when to execute it would violate rights and privileges of the complainant which had been guaranteed by the Constitution, and would work irreparable damage and injury to him, has never been departed from. The same principle is decided in Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 67. And see Missouri &c. v. Missouri Railroad Commissioners, 183 U.S. 53.
The cases above cited do not include one exactly like this under discussion. They serve to illustrate the principles upon which many cases have been decided. We have not cited all the cases, as we have not thought it necessary. But the injunction asked for in the Ayers Case, 123 U.S. (supra), was to restrain the state officers from commencing suits under the act of May 12, 1887 (alleged to be unconstitutional), in the name of the State and brought to recover taxes for its use, on the ground that if such suits were commenced they would be a breach of a contract with the State. The injunction was declared illegal because the suit itself could not be entertained as it was one against the State to enforce its alleged contract. It was said, however, that if the court had power to entertain such a suit, it would have power to grant the restraining order *153 preventing the commencement of suits. (Page 487.) It was not stated that the suit or the injunction was necessarily confined to a case of a threatened direct trespass upon or injury to property.
Whether the commencement of a suit could ever be regarded as an actionable injury to another, equivalent in some cases to a trespass such as is set forth in some of the foregoing cases, has received attention in the rate cases, so called. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U.S. 362 (a rate case), was a suit against the members of a railroad commission (created under an act of the State of Texas) and the Attorney General, all of whom were held suable, and that such suit was not one against the State. The Commission was enjoined from enforcing the rates it had established under the act, and the Attorney General was enjoined from instituting suits to recover penalties for failing to conform to the rates fixed by the Commission under such act. It is true the statute in that case creating the board provided that suit might be maintained by any dissatisfied railroad company, or other party in interest, in a court of competent jurisdiction in Travis County, Texas, against the Commission as defendant. This court held that such language permitted a suit in the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Texas, which embraced Travis County, but it also held that, irrespective of that consent, the suit was not in effect a suit against the State (although the Attorney General was enjoined), and therefore not prohibited under the amendment. It was said in the opinion, which was delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer, that the suit could not in any fair sense be considered a suit against the State (page 392), and the conclusion of the court was that the objection to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was not tenable, whether that jurisdiction was rested (page 393), ""upon the provisions of the statute or upon the general jurisdiction of the court existing by virtue of the statutes of Congress and the sanction of the Constitution of the United States."" Each of these grounds is effective and both are of equal force *154 Union Pacific &c. v. Mason City Company, 199 U.S. 160, 166.
In Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S. 466 (another rate case), it was again held that a suit against individuals, for the purpose of preventing them, as officers of the State, from enforcing, by the commencement of suits or by indictment, an unconstitutional enactment to the injury of the rights of the plaintiff, was not a suit against a State within the meaning of the Amendment. At page 518, in answer to the objection that the suit was really against the State, it was said: ""It is the settled doctrine of this court that a suit against individuals for the purpose of preventing them as officers of a State from enforcing an unconstitutional enactment to the injury of the rights of the plaintiff, is not a suit against the State within the meaning of that Amendment."" The suit was to enjoin the enforcement of a statute of Nebraska because it was alleged to be unconstitutional, on account of the rates being too low to afford some compensation to the company, and contrary, therefore, to the Fourteenth Amendment.
There was no special provision in the statute as to rates, making it the duty of the Attorney General to enforce it, but under his general powers he had authority to ask for a mandamus to enforce such or any other law. State of Nebraska ex rel. &c. v. The Fremont &c. Railroad Co., 22 Nebraska, 313.
The final decree enjoined the Attorney General from bringing any suit (page 477) by way of injunction, mandamus, civil action or indictment, for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the act. The fifth section of the act provided that an action might be brought by a railroad company in the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska; but this court did not base its decision on that section when it held that a suit of the nature of that before it was not a suit against a State, although brought against individual state officers for the purpose of enjoining them from enforcing, either by civil proceeding or indictment, an unconstitutional enactment to the injury of the plaintiff's right. (Page 518.)
*155 This decision was reaffirmed in Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537, 542.
Attention is also directed to the case of Missouri &c. Rwy. Co. v. Missouri R.R. &c. Commissioners, 183 U.S. 53. That was a suit brought in a state court of Missouri by the railroad commissioners of the State, who had the powers granted them by the statutes set forth in the report. Their suit was against the railway company to compel it to discontinue certain charges it was making for crossing the Boonville bridge over the Missouri River. The defendant sought to remove the case to the Federal court, which the plaintiffs resisted, and the state court refused to remove on the ground that the real plaintiff was the State of Missouri, and it was proper to go behind the face of the record to determine that fact. In regular manner the case came here, and this court held that the State was not the real party plaintiff, and the case had therefore been properly removed from the state court, whose judgment was thereupon reversed.
Applying the same principles of construction to the removal act which had been applied to the Eleventh Amendment, it was said by this court that the State might be the real party plaintiff when the relief sought enures to it alone, and in whose favor the judgment or decree, if for the plaintiff, will effectively operate.
Although the case is one arising under the removal act and does not involve the Eleventh Amendment, it nevertheless illustrates the question now before us, and reiterates the doctrine that the State is not a party to a suit simply because the State Railroad Commission is such party.
The doctrine of Smyth v. Ames is also referred to and reiterated in Gunter, Attorney General, v. Atlantic &c. Railroad Co., 200 U.S. 273, 283. See also McNeill v. Southern Railway, 202 U.S. 543-559; Mississippi Railroad Commission v. Illinois &c. Railroad Co., 203 U.S. 335, 340.
The various authorities we have referred to furnish ample justification for the assertion that individuals, who, as officers *156 of the State, are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the State, and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties affected an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a Federal court of equity from such action.
It is objected, however, that Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516, has somewhat limited this principle, and that, upon the authority of that case, it must be held that the State was a party to the suit in the United States Circuit Court, and the bill should have been dismissed as to the Attorney General on that ground.
We do not think such contention is well founded. The doctrine of Smyth v. Ames was neither overruled nor doubted in the Fitts case. In that case the Alabama legislature, by the act of 1895, fixed the tolls to be charged for crossing the bridge. The penalties for disobeying that act, by demanding and receiving higher tolls, were to be collected by the persons paying them. No officer of the State had any official connection with the recovery of such penalties. The indictments mentioned were found under another state statute, set forth at page 520 of the report of the case, which provided a fine against an officer of a company for taking any greater rate of toll than was authorized by its charter, or, if the charter did not specify the amount, then the fine was imposed for charging any unreasonable toll, to be determined by a jury. This act was not claimed to be unconstitutional, and the indictments found under it were not necessarily connected with the alleged unconstitutional act fixing the tolls. As no state officer who was made a party bore any close official connection with the act fixing the tolls, the making of such officer a party defendant was a simple effort to test the constitutionality of such act in that way, and there is no principle upon which it could be done. A state superintendent of schools might as well have been made a party. In the light of this fact it was said in the opinion (page 530):
*157 ""In the present case, as we have said, neither of the State officers named held any special relation to the particular statute alleged to be unconstitutional. They were not expressly directed to see to its enforcement. If, because they were law officers of the State, a case could be made for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the statute, by an injunction suit brought against them, then the constitutionality of every act passed by the legislature could be tested by a suit against the governor and the attorney general, based upon the theory that the former, as the executive of the State was, in a general sense, charged with the execution of all its laws, and the latter, as attorney general, might represent the State in litigation involving the enforcement of its statutes. That would be a very convenient way for obtaining a speedy judicial determination of questions of constitutional law which may be raised by individuals, but it is a mode which cannot be applied to the States of the Union consistently with the fundamental principle that they cannot, without their assent, be brought into any court at the suit of private persons.""
In making an officer of the State a party defendant in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an act alleged to be unconstitutional it is plain that such officer must have some connection with the enforcement of the act, or else it is merely making him a party as a representative of the State, and thereby attempting to make the State a party.
It has not, however, been held that it was necessary that such duty should be declared in the same act which is to be enforced. In some cases, it is true, the duty of enforcement has been so imposed (154 U.S. 362, 366, § 19 of the act), but that may possibly make the duty more clear; if it otherwise exist it is equally efficacious. The fact that the state officer by virtue of his office has some connection with the enforcement of the act is the important and material fact, and whether it arises out of the general law, or is specially created by the act itself, is not material so long as it exists.
In the course of the opinion in the Fitts case the Reagan and *158 Smyth cases were referred to (with others) as instances of state officers specially charged with the execution of a state enactment alleged to be unconstitutional, and who commit under its authority some specific wrong or trespass to the injury of plaintiff's rights. In those cases the only wrong or injury or trespass involved was the threatened commencement of suits to enforce the statute as to rates, and the threat of such commencement was in each case regarded as sufficient to authorize the issuing of an injunction to prevent the same. The threat to commence those suits under such circumstances was therefore necessarily held to be equivalent to any other threatened wrong or injury to the property of a plaintiff which had theretofore been held sufficient to authorize the suit against the officer. The being specially charged with the duty to enforce the statute is sufficiently apparent when such duty exists under the general authority of some law, even though such authority is not to be found in the particular act. It might exist by reason of the general duties of the officer to enforce it as a law of the State.
The officers in the Fitts case occupied the position of having no duty at all with regard to the act, and could not be properly made parties to the suit for the reason stated.
It is also objected that as the statute does not specifically make it the duty of the Attorney General (assuming he has that general right) to enforce it, he has under such circumstances a full general discretion whether to attempt its enforcement or not, and the court cannot interfere to control him as Attorney General in the exercise of his discretion.
In our view there is no interference with his discretion under the facts herein. There is no doubt that the court cannot control the exercise of the discretion of an officer. It can only direct affirmative action where the officer having some duty to perform not involving discretion, but merely ministerial in its nature, refuses or neglects to take such action. In that case the court can direct the defendant to perform this merely ministerial duty. Board of Liquidation v. McComb, 92 U.S. 531, 541
*159 The general discretion regarding the enforcement of the laws when and as he deems appropriate is not interfered with by an injunction which restrains the state officer from taking any steps towards the enforcement of an unconstitutional enactment to the injury of complainant. In such case no affirmative action of any nature is directed, and the officer is simply prohibited from doing an act which he had no legal right to do. An injunction to prevent him from doing that which he has no legal right to do is not an interference with the discretion of an officer.
It is also argued that the only proceeding which the Attorney General could take to enforce the statute, so far as his office is concerned, was one by mandamus, which would be commenced by the State in its sovereign and governmental character, and that the right to bring such action is a necessary attribute of a sovereign government. It is contended that the complainants do not complain and they care nothing about any action which Mr. Young might take or bring as an ordinary individual, but that he was complained of as an officer, to whose discretion is confided the use of the name of the State of Minnesota so far as litigation is concerned, and that when or how he shall use it is a matter resting in his discretion and cannot be controlled by any court.
The answer to all this is the same as made in every case where an official claims to be acting under the authority of the State. The act to be enforced is alleged to be unconstitutional, and if it be so, the use of the name of the State to enforce an unconstitutional act to the injury of complainants is a proceeding without the authority of and one which does not affect the State in its sovereign or governmental capacity. It is simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting by the use of the name of the State to enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional. If the act which the state Attorney General seeks to enforce be a violation of the Federal Constitution, the officer in proceeding under such enactment comes into conflict with the *160 superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct. The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States. See In re Ayers, supra, page 507. It would be an injury to complainant to harass it with a multiplicity of suits or litigation generally in an endeavor to enforce penalties under an unconstitutional enactment, and to prevent it ought to be within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. If the question of unconstitutionality with reference, at least, to the Federal Constitution be first raised in a Federal court that court, as we think is shown by the authorities cited hereafter, has the right to decide it to the exclusion of all other courts.
The question remains whether the Attorney General had, by the law of the State, so far as concerns these rate acts, any duty with regard to the enforcement of the same. By his official conduct it seems that he regarded it as a duty connected with his office to compel the company to obey the commodity act, for he commenced proceedings to enforce such obedience immediately after the injunction issued, at the risk of being found guilty of contempt by so doing.
The duties of the Attorney General, as decided by the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota, are created partly by statute and exist partly as at common law. State ex rel. Young, Attorney General, v. Robinson (decided June 7, 1907), 112 N.W. Rep. 269. In the above-cited case it was held that the Attorney General might institute, conduct and maintain all suits and proceedings he might deem necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the State, the preservation of order and the protection of public rights, and that there were no statutory restrictions in that State limiting the duties of the Attorney General in such case.
Section 3 of chapter 227 of the General Laws of Minnesota, 1905 (same law, § 58, Revised Laws of Minnesota, 1905), *161 imposes the duty upon the Attorney General to cause proceedings to be instituted against any corporation whenever it shall have offended against the laws of the State. By § 1960 of the Revised Laws of 1905 it is also provided that the Attorney General shall be ex officio attorney for the railroad commission and it is made his duty to institute and prosecute all actions which the Commission shall order brought, and shall render the commissioners all counsel and advice necessary for the proper performance of their duties.
It is said that the Attorney General is only bound to act when the Commission orders action to be brought, and that § 5 of the commodity act (April 18, 1907) expressly provides that no duty shall rest upon the Commission to enforce the act, and hence no duty other than that which is discretionary rests upon the Attorney General in that matter. The provision is somewhat unusual, but the reasons for its insertion in that act are not material, and neither require nor justify comment by this court.
It would seem to be clear that the Attorney General, under his power existing at common law and by virtue of these various statutes, had a general duty imposed upon him, which includes the right and the power to enforce the statutes of the State, including, of course, the act in question, if it were constitutional. His power by virtue of his office sufficiently connected him with the duty of enforcement to make him a proper party to a suit of the nature of the one now before the United States Circuit Court.
It is further objected (and the objection really forms part of the contention that the State cannot be sued) that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to enjoin criminal proceedings, by indictment or otherwise, under the state law. This, as a general rule, is true. But there are exceptions. When such indictment or proceeding is brought to enforce an alleged unconstitutional statute, which is the subject matter of inquiry in a suit already pending in a Federal court, the latter court having first obtained jurisdiction over the subject matter, has *162 the right, in both civil and criminal cases, to hold and maintain such jurisdiction, to the exclusion of all other courts, until its duty is fully performed. Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537, 544. But the Federal court cannot, of course, interfere in a case where the proceedings were already pending in a state court. Taylor v. Taintor, 16 Wall. 366, 370; Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148.
Where one commences a criminal proceeding who is already party to a suit then pending in a court of equity, if the criminal proceedings are brought to enforce the same right that is in issue before that court, the latter may enjoin such criminal proceedings. Davis &c. Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U.S. 207. In Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 195 U.S. 223-241, it is remarked by Mr. Justice Day, in delivering the opinion of the court, that ""it is well settled that where property rights will be destroyed, unlawful interference by criminal proceedings under a void law or ordinance may be reached and controlled by a court of equity."" Smyth v. Ames (supra) distinctly enjoined the proceedings by indictment to compel obedience to the rate act.
These cases show that a court of equity is not always precluded from granting an injunction to stay proceedings in criminal cases, and we have no doubt the principle applies in a case such as the present. In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 211, is not to the contrary. That case holds that in general a court of equity has no jurisdiction of a bill to stay criminal proceedings, but it expressly states an exception, ""unless they are instituted by a party to the suit already pending before it and to try the same right that is in issue there."" Various authorities are cited to sustain the exception. The criminal proceedings here that could be commenced by the state authorities would be under the statutes relating to passenger or freight rates, and their validity is the very question involved in the suit in the United States Circuit Court. The right to restrain proceedings by mandamus is based upon the same foundation and governed by the same principles.
*163 It is proper to add that the right to enjoin an individual, even though a state official, from commencing suits under circumstances already stated, does not include the power to restrain a court from acting in any case brought before it, either of a civil or criminal nature, nor does it include power to prevent any investigation or action by a grand jury. The latter body is part of the machinery of a criminal court, and an injunction against a state court would be a violation of the whole scheme of our Government. If an injunction against an individual is disobeyed, and he commences proceedings before a grand jury or in a court, such disobedience is personal only, and the court or jury can proceed without incurring any penalty on that account.
The difference between the power to enjoin an individual from doing certain things, and the power to enjoin courts from proceeding in their own way to exercise jurisdiction is plain, and no power to do the latter exists because of a power to do the former.
It is further objected that there is a plain and adequate remedy at law open to the complainants and that a court of equity, therefore, has no jurisdiction in such case. It has been suggested that the proper way to test the constitutionality of the act is to disobey it, at least once, after which the company might obey the act pending subsequent proceedings to test its validity. But in the event of a single violation the prosecutor might not avail himself of the opportunity to make the test, as obedience to the law was thereafter continued, and he might think it unnecessary to start an inquiry. If, however, he should do so while the company was thereafter obeying the law, several years might elapse before there was a final determination of the question, and if it should be determined that the law was invalid the property of the company would have been taken during that time without due process of law, and there would be no possibility of its recovery.
Another obstacle to making the test on the part of the company might be to find an agent or employe who would disobey *164 the law, with a possible fine and imprisonment staring him in the face if the act should be held valid. Take the passenger rate act, for instance: A sale of a single ticket above the price mentioned in that act might subject the ticket agent to a charge of felony, and upon conviction to a fine of five thousand dollars and imprisonment for five years. It is true the company might pay the fine, but the imprisonment the agent would have to suffer personally. It would not be wonderful if, under such circumstances, there would not be a crowd of agents offering to disobey the law. The wonder would be that a single agent should be found ready to take the risk.
If, however, one should be found and the prosecutor should elect to proceed against him, the defense that the act was invalid, because the rates established by it were too low, would require a long and difficult examination of quite complicated facts upon which the validity of the act depended. Such investigation it would be almost impossible to make before a jury, as such body could not intelligently pass upon the matter. Questions of the cost of transportation of passengers and freight, the net earnings of the road, the separation of the cost and earnings, within the State from those arising beyond its boundaries, all depending upon the testimony of experts and the examination of figures relating to these subjects, as well, possibly, as the expenses attending the building and proper cost of the road, would necessarily form the chief matter of inquiry, and intelligent answers could only be given after a careful and prolonged examination of the whole evidence, and the making of calculations based thereon. All material evidence having been taken upon these issues, it has been held that it ought to be referred to the most competent and reliable master to make all needed computations and to find therefrom the necessary facts upon which a judgment might be rendered that might be reviewed by this court. Chicago &c. Railway Co. v. Tompkins, 176 U.S. 167. From all these considerations it is plain that this is not a proper suit for investigation by a jury. Suits for penalties, or indictment *165 or other criminal proceedings for a violation of the act, would therefore furnish no reasonable or adequate opportunity for the presentation of a defense founded upon the assertion that the rates were too low and therefore the act invalid.
We do not say the company could not interpose this defense in an action to recover penalties or upon the trial of an indictment (St. Louis &c. Ry. Co. v. Gill, 156 U.S. 649), but the facility of proving it in either case falls so far below that which would obtain in a court of equity that comparison is scarcely possible.
To await proceedings against the company in a state court grounded upon a disobedience of the act, and then, if necessary, obtain a review in this court by writ of error to the highest state court, would place the company in peril of large loss and its agents in great risk of fines and imprisonment if it should be finally determined that the act was valid. This risk the company ought not to be required to take. Over eleven thousand millions of dollars, it is estimated, are invested in railroad property, owned by many thousands of people who are scattered over the whole country from ocean to ocean, and they are entitled to equal protection from the laws and from the courts, with the owners of all other kinds of property, no more, no less. The courts having jurisdiction, Federal or state, should at all times be open to them as well as to others, for the purpose of protecting their property and their legal rights.
All the objections to a remedy at law as being plainly inadequate are obviated by a suit in equity, making all who are directly interested parties to the suit, and enjoining the enforcement of the act until the decision of the court upon the legal question.
An act of the legislature fixing rates, either for passengers or freight, is to be regarded as prima facie valid, and the onus rests upon the company to prove its assertion to the contrary. Under such circumstances it was stated by Mr. Justice Miller, *166 in his concurring opinion in Chicago &c. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U.S. 418, 460, that the proper, if not the only, mode of judicial relief against the tariff of rates established by the legislature or by its Commission is by a bill in chancery, asserting its unreasonable character, and that until the decree of the court in such equity suit was obtained it was not competent for each individual having dealings with a carrier, or for the carrier in regard to each individual who demands its services, to raise a contest in the courts over the questions which ought to be settled in this general and conclusive manner. This remedy by bill in equity is referred to and approved by Mr. Justice Shiras, in delivering the opinion of the court in St. Louis &c. Co. v. Gill, 156 U.S. 649, 659, 666, although that question was not then directly before the court. Such remedy is undoubtedly the most convenient, the most comprehensive and the most orderly way in which the rights of all parties can be properly, fairly and adequately passed upon. It cannot be to the real interest of anyone to injure or cripple the resources of the railroad companies of the country, because the prosperity of both the railroads and the country is most intimately connected. The question of sufficiency of rates is important and controlling, and being of a judicial nature it ought to be settled at the earliest moment by some court, and when a Federal court first obtains jurisdiction it ought, on general principles of jurisprudence, to be permitted to finish the inquiry and make a conclusive judgment to the exclusion of all other courts. This is all that is claimed, and this, we think, must be admitted.
Finally it is objected that the necessary result of upholding this suit in the Circuit Court will be to draw to the lower Federal courts a great flood of litigation of this character, where one Federal judge would have it in his power to enjoin proceedings by state officials to enforce the legislative acts of the State, either by criminal or civil actions. To this it may be answered, in the first place, that no injunction ought to be granted unless in a case reasonably free from doubt. We *167 think such rule is, and will be, followed by all the judges of the Federal courts.
And, again, it must be remembered that jurisdiction of this general character has, in fact, been exercised by Federal courts from the time of Osborn v. United States Bank up to the present; the only difference in regard to the case of Osborn and the case in hand being that in this case the injury complained of is the threatened commencement of suits, civil or criminal, to enforce the act, instead of, as in the Osborn case, an actual and direct trespass upon or interference with tangible property. A bill filed to prevent the commencement of suits to enforce an unconstitutional act, under the circumstances already mentioned, is no new invention, as we have already seen. The difference between an actual and direct interference with tangible property and the enjoining of state officers from enforcing an unconstitutional act, is not of a radical nature, and does not extend, in truth, the jurisdiction of the courts over the subject matter. In the case of the interference with property the person enjoined is assuming to act in his capacity as an official of the State, and justification for his interference is claimed by reason of his position as a state official. Such official cannot so justify when acting under an unconstitutional enactment of the legislature. So, where the state official, instead of directly interfering with tangible property, is about to commence suits, which have for their object the enforcement of an act which violates the Federal Constitution, to the great and irreparable injury of the complainants, he is seeking the same justification from the authority of the State as in other cases. The sovereignty of the State is, in reality, no more involved in one case than in the other. The State cannot in either case impart to the official immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States. See In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 507.
This supreme authority, which arises from the specific provisions of the Constitution itself, is nowhere more fully illustrated than in the series of decisions under the Federal habeas *168 corpus statute (§ 753, Rev. Stat.), in some of which cases persons in the custody of state officers for alleged crimes against the State have been taken from that custody and discharged by a Federal court or judge, because the imprisonment was adjudged to be in violation of the Federal Constitution. The right to so discharge has not been doubted by this court, and it has never been supposed there was any suit against the State by reason of serving the writ upon one of the officers of the State in whose custody the person was found. In some of the cases the writ has been refused as matter of discretion, but in others it has been granted, while the power has been fully recognized in all. Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241; In re Loney, 134 U.S. 372; In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1; Baker v. Grice, 169 U.S. 284; Ohio v. Thomas, 173 U.S. 276; Minnesota v. Brundage, 180 U.S. 499, 502; Reid v. Jones, 187 U.S. 153; United States v. Lewis, 200 U.S. 1; In re Lincoln, 202 U.S. 178; Urquhart v. Brown, 205 U.S. 179.
It is somewhat difficult to appreciate the distinction which, while admitting that the taking of such a person from the custody of the State by virtue of service of the writ on the state officer in whose custody he is found, is not a suit against the State, and yet service of a writ on the Attorney General to prevent his enforcing an unconstitutional enactment of a state legislature is a suit against the State.
There is nothing in the case before us that ought properly to breed hostility to the customary operation of Federal courts of justice in cases of this character.
The rule to show cause is discharged and the petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari is dismissed.
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.Although the history of this litigation is set forth in the opinion of the court, I deem it appropriate to restate the principal facts of the case in direct connection with my examination of the question upon which the decision turns. *169 That question is, whether the suit in the Circuit Court of the United States was, as to the relief sought against the Attorney General of Minnesota, forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, declaring that ""the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State."" That examination, I may say at the outset, is entered upon with no little embarrassment, in view of the fact that the views expressed by me are not shared by my brethren. I may also frankly admit embarrassment arising from certain views stated in dissenting opinions heretofore delivered by me which did not, at the time, meet the approval of my brethren, and which I do not now myself entertain. What I shall say in this opinion will be in substantial accord with what the court has heretofore decided, while the opinion of the court departs, as I think, from principles previously announced by it upon full consideration. I propose to adhere to former decisions of the court, whatever may have been once my opinion as to certain aspects of this general question.
The plaintiffs in the suit referred to, Perkins and Shepard, were shareholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company and citizens, respectively, of Iowa and Minnesota. The defendants were the railway company, Edward T. Young, Attorney General of Minnesota, the several members of the State Railroad and Warehouse Commission, and certain persons who were shippers of freight over the lines of that railway.
The general object of the suit was to prevent compliance with the provisions of certain acts of the Minnesota legislature and certain orders of the State Railroad and Warehouse Commission, indicating the rates which the State permits to be charged for the transportation of passengers and commodities upon railroads within its limits; also, to prevent shippers from bringing actions against the railway company to enforce those acts and orders.
*170 The bill, among other things, prayed that Edward T. Young, ""as Attorney General of the State of Minnesota,"" and the members of the State Railroad and Warehouse Commission (naming them) be enjoined from all attempts to compel the railway company to put in force the rates or any of them prescribed by said orders, and ""from taking any action, step or proceeding against said Railway Company, or any of its officers, directors, agents or employes, to enforce any penalties or remedies for the violation by said Railway Company of said orders or either of them;"" and that said Young, ""as Attorney General,"" be enjoined from taking any action, step or proceeding against the railway company, its officers, agents or employees, to enforce the penalties and remedies specified in those acts.
The court gave a temporary injunction as prayed for. The Attorney General of Minnesota appeared specially and, without submitting to or acknowledging the jurisdiction of the court, moved to dismiss the suit as to him, upon the ground that the State had not consented to be sued, and also because the bill was exhibited against him ""as, and only as, the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota,""to restrain him, by injunction, from exercising the discretion vested in him to commence appropriate actions, on behalf of the State, to enforce or to test the validity of its laws. He directly raised the question that the suit as to him, in his official capacity, was one against the State, in violation of the Eleventh Amendment.
In response to an order to show cause why the injunction asked for should not be granted the Attorney General also appeared specially and urged like objections to the suit against him in the Circuit Court.
After hearing the parties the court made an order, September 23, 1907, whereby the railway company, its officers, directors, agents, servants and employes, were enjoined until the further order of the court from publishing, adopting or putting into effect the tariffs, rates or charges specified in the *171 act of April 18, 1907. The court likewise enjoined the defendant Young, ""as Attorney General of the State of Minnesota,"" from ""taking or instituting any action, suit, step or proceeding to enforce the penalties and remedies specified in said acts or either thereof, or to compel obedience to said act or compliance therewith or any part thereof."" A like injunction was granted against the defendant shippers.
On the next day, September 24, 1907, the State of Minnesota, ""on the relation of Edward T. Young, Attorney General,"" commenced an action in one of its own courts against the Northern Pacific Railway Company — the only relief sought being a mandamus ordering the company to adopt, publish, keep for public inspection, and put into effect, as the rates and charges to be maintained for the transportation of freight between stations in Minnesota, those named and specified in what is known as chapter 232 of the Session Laws of Minnesota for 1907. That was the act which it was the object of the Perkins-Shepard suit in the Federal court to strike down and nullify. An alternative writ of mandamus, such as the State asked, was issued by the state court.
The institution, in the state court, by the State, on the relation of its Attorney General, of the mandamus proceeding against the railway company having been brought to the attention of the Federal Circuit Court, a rule was issued against the defendant Young to show cause why he should not be punished as for contempt. Answering that rule, he alleged, among other things, that the mandamus proceeding was brought by and on behalf of the State, through him as its Attorney General; that in every way possible he had objected to such jurisdiction on the ground that the action was commenced against him solely as the Attorney General for Minnesota in order to prevent him from instituting in the proper courts civil actions for and in the name of the State to enforce or test the validity of its laws; that there is no other action or proceeding pending or contemplated by this defendant against said railway company, except said proceedings in mandamus *172 hereinbefore referred to. Defendant expressly disclaimed any intention to treat this court with disrespect in the commencement of the proceedings referred to, ""but believing that the decision of this court in this action, holding that it had jurisdiction to enjoin this defendant, as such Attorney General, from performing his discretionary official duties, was in conflict with the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as the same has been interpreted and applied by the United States Supreme Court, defendant believed it to be his duty as such Attorney General to commence said mandamus proceedings for and in behalf of the State, and it was in this belief that said proceedings were commenced solely for the purpose of enforcing the said law of the State of Minnesota.""
The rule was heard, and the Attorney General was held to be in contempt, the order of the Federal court being: ""Ordered further, that said Edward T. Young forthwith dismiss or cause to be dismissed the suit of The State of Minnesota on the Relation of Edward T. Young, Attorney General, Plaintiff, v. Northern Pacific Railway Company, Defendant, heretofore instituted by him in the District Court of the County of Ramsey, Second Judicial District, State of Minnesota. Ordered further, that for his said contempt said Edward T. Young be fined the sum of one hundred dollars and stand committed in the custody of the Marshal of this court until the same be paid, and until he purge himself of his contempt by dismissing or causing to be dismissed said suit last herein mentioned.""
The present proceeding was commenced by an original application by Young to this court for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner, in his application, proceeds upon the ground that he is held in custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The petition set out all the steps taken in the suit in the Federal court, alleging, among other things: ""That your petitioner's office as Attorney General of the State of Minnesota is established and provided for by the constitution of the said State, section 1 of Article V thereof *173 providing as follows, to wit: `The Executive Department shall consist of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor, Treasurer and Attorney General, who shall be chosen by the electors of the State.' That neither by statute nor otherwise is your petitioner charged with any special duty of a ministerial character in the doing or not doing of which said complainants in the said bill of complaint or the said Northern Pacific Railway Company had any legal right, and that whatever duties your petitioner had or has with respect to the several matters complained of in the said bill of complaint, are of an executive and discretionary nature. That in no case could your petitioner, even though it was his intention so to do, which it was not, deprive the said complainants or the said Northern Pacific Railway Company, or either of them, of any property, nor could he trespass upon their rights in any particular, and that all he could do as Attorney General as aforesaid and all that it was his duty to do in that capacity, and all that he intended to do or would do, was to commence formal judicial proceedings in the appropriate court of Minnesota against the said Northern Pacific Railway Company, its officers, agents and employes, to compel the said company, its agents and servants, to adopt and put in force the schedule of freight rates, tariffs and charges prescribed by said chapter 232, Laws 1907, of the State of Minnesota."" He renewed the objection that the suit instituted by Perkins and Shepard, in so far as the same is against him, was a suit against the State to prevent his commencing the proposed action in the name of the State, and was in restraint of the State itself, ""and that the said suit is one against the said State in violation of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that therefore the same is and was, so far as your petitioner is concerned, beyond the jurisdiction of the said Circuit Court,"" etc.
This statement will sufficiently indicate the nature of the question to be now examined upon its merits.
Let it be observed that the suit instituted by Perkins and *174 Shepard in the Circuit Court of the United States was, as to the defendant Young, one against him as, and only because he was, Attorney General of Minnesota. No relief was sought against him individually but only in his capacity as Attorney General. And the manifest, indeed the avowed and admitted, object of seeking such relief was to tie the hands of the State so that it could not in any manner or by any mode of proceeding, in its own courts, test the validity of the statutes and orders in question. It would therefore seem clear that within the true meaning of the Eleventh Amendment the suit brought in the Federal court was one, in legal effect, against the State — as much so as if the State had been formally named on the record as a party — and therefore it was a suit to which, under the Amendment, so far as the State or its Attorney General was concerned, the judicial power of the United States did not and could not extend. If this proposition be sound it will follow — indeed, it is conceded that if, so far as relief is sought against the Attorney General of Minnesota, this be a suit against the State — then the order of the Federal court enjoining that officer from taking any action, suit, step or proceeding to compel the railway company to obey the Minnesota statute was beyond the jurisdiction of that court and wholly void; in which case, that officer was at liberty to proceed in the discharge of his official duties as defined by the laws of the State, and the order adjudging him to be in contempt for bringing the mandamus proceeding in the state court was a nullity.
The fact that the Federal Circuit Court had, prior to the institution of the mandamus suit in the state court, preliminarily (but not finally) held the statutes of Minnesota and the orders of its Railroad and Warehouse Commission in question to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States, was no reason why that court should have laid violent hands upon the Attorney General of Minnesota and by its orders have deprived the State of the services of its constitutional law officer in its own courts. Yet that is what was done by *175 the Federal Circuit Court; for, the intangible thing, called a State, however extensive its powers, can never appear or be represented or known in any court in a litigated case, except by and through its officers. When, therefore, the Federal court forbade the defendant Young, as Attorney General of Minnesota, from taking any action, suit, step or proceeding whatever looking to the enforcement of the statutes in question, it said in effect to the State of Minnesota: ""It is true that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to its people, and it is true that under the Constitution the judicial power of the United States does not extend to any suit brought against a State by a citizen of another State or by a citizen or subject of a foreign State, yet the Federal court adjudges that you, the State, although a sovereign for many important governmental purposes, shall not appear in your own courts, by your law officer, with the view of enforcing, or even for determining the validity of the state enactments which the Federal court has, upon a preliminary hearing, declared to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States.""
This principle, if firmly established, would work a radical change in our governmental system. It would inaugurate a new era in the American judicial system and in the relations of the National and state governments. It would enable the subordinate Federal courts to supervise and control the official action of the States as if they were ""dependencies"" or provinces. It would place the States of the Union in a condition of inferiority never dreamed of when the Constitution was adopted or when the Eleventh Amendment was made a part of the Supreme Law of the Land. I cannot suppose that the great men who framed the Constitution ever thought the time would come when a subordinate Federal court, having no power to compel a State, in its corporate capacity, to appear before it as a litigant, would yet assume to deprive a State of the right to be represented in its own courts by its *176 regular law officer. That is what the court below did, as to Minnesota, when it adjudged that the appearance of the defendant Young in the state court, as the Attorney General of Minnesota, representing his State as its chief law officer, was a contempt of the authority of the Federal court, punishable by fine and imprisonment. Too little consequence has been attached to the fact that the courts of the States are under an obligation equally strong with that resting upon the courts of the Union to respect and enforce the provisions of the Federal Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land, and to guard rights secured or guaranteed by that instrument. We must assume — a decent respect for the States requires us to assume — that the state courts will enforce every right secured by the Constitution. If they fail to do so, the party complaining has a clear remedy for the protection of his rights; for, he can come by writ of error, in an orderly, judicial way, from the highest court of the State to this tribunal for redress in respect of every right granted or secured by that instrument and denied by the state court. The state courts, it should be remembered, have jurisdiction concurrent with the courts of the United States of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or equity involving a prescribed amount, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States. 25 Stat. 434. And this court has said: ""A state court of original jurisdiction, having the parties before it, may consistently with existing Federal legislation determine cases at law or in equity arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States or involving rights dependent upon such Constitution or laws. Upon the state courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof, whenever those rights are involved in any suit or proceeding before them; for the judges of the state courts are required to take an oath to support that Constitution, and they are bound by it, and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties *177 made under their authority, as the supreme law of the land, `anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.' If they fail therein, and withhold or deny rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the party aggrieved may bring the case from the highest court of the State in which the question could be decided to this court for final and conclusive determination."" Robb v. Connolly, 111 U.S. 624, 637. So that an order of the Federal court preventing the State from having the services of its Attorney General in one of its own courts, except at the risk of his being fined and arrested, cannot be justified upon the ground that the question of constitutional law, involved in the enforcement of the statutes in question, was beyond the competency of a state court to consider and determine, primarily, as between the parties before it in a suit brought by the State itself.
At the argument of this case counsel for the railway company insisted that the provisions of the act in question were so drastic that they could be enforced by the State in its own courts with such persistency and in such a manner as, in a very brief period, to have the railway officers and agents all in jail, the business of the company destroyed and its property confiscated by heavy and successive penalties, before a final judicial decision as to the constitutionality of the act could be obtained. I infer from some language in the court's opinion that these apprehensions are shared by some of my brethren. And this supposed danger to the railway company and its shareholders seems to have been the basis of the action of the Federal Circuit Court when, by its order directed against the Attorney General of Minnesota, it practically excluded the State from its own courts in respect of the issues here involved. But really no such question as to the state statute is here involved or need be now considered; for it cannot possibly arise on the hearing of the present application of that officer for discharge on habeas corpus. The only question now before this court is whether the suit by Perkins and Shepard in the Federal *178 court was not, upon its face, as to the relief sought against the Attorney General of Minnesota, a suit against the State. Stated in another form, the question is whether that court may, by operating upon that officer in his official capacity, by means of fine and imprisonment, prevent the State from being represented by its law officer in one of its own courts? If the Federal court could not thus put manacles upon the State so as to prevent it from being represented by its Attorney General in its own court and from having the state court pass upon the validity of the state enactment in question in the Perkins-Shepard suit, that is an end to this habeas corpus proceeding, and the Attorney General of Minnesota should be discharged by order of this court from custody.
It is to be observed that when the State was in effect prohibited by the order of the Federal court from appearing in its own courts, there was no danger, absolutely none whatever, from anything that the Attorney General had ever done or proposed to do, that the property of the railway company would be confiscated and its officers and agents imprisoned, beyond the power of that company to stay any wrong done by bringing to this court, in regular order, any final judgment of the state court, in the mandamus suit, which may have been in derogation of a Federal right. When the Attorney General instituted the mandamus proceeding in the state court against the railway company there was in force, it must not be forgotten, and order of injunction by the Federal court which prevented that company from obeying the state law. There was consequently no danger from that direction. Besides, the mandamus proceeding was not instituted for the recovery of any of the penalties prescribed by the state law, and therefore no judgment in that case could operate directly upon the property of the railway company or upon the persons of its officers or agents. The Attorney General in his response to the rule against him assured the Federal court that he did not contemplate any proceeding whatever against the railway company except the one in mandamus. Suppose the *179 mandamus case had been finally decided in the state court, the way was open for the railway company to preserve any question it made as to its rights under the Constitution, and, in the event of a decision adverse to it in that court, at once to carry the case to the highest court of Minnesota and thence by a writ of error bring it to this court. That course would have served to determine every question of constitutional law raised by the suit in the Federal court in an orderly way without trampling upon the State, and without interfering, in the meantime, with the operation of the railway property in the accustomed way. Instead of adopting that course — so manifestly consistent with the dignity and authority of both the Federal and state judicial tribunals — the Federal court practically closed the state courts against the State itself when it adjudged that the Attorney General, without regard to the wishes of the Governor of Minnesota, and without reference to his duties as prescribed by the laws of that State, should stand in the custody of the Marshal, unless he dismissed the mandamus suit. If the Federal court could thus prohibit the law officer of the State from representing it in a suit brought in the state court, why might not the bill in the Federal court be so amended that that court could reach all the district attorneys in Minnesota and forbid them from bringing to the attention of grand juries and the state courts violations of the state act by the railway company? And if a grand jury was about to inquire into the acts of the railway company in respect of the matter of its rates, why may not the Federal court, proceeding upon the same grounds on which it has moved against the Attorney General, enjoin the finding or returning of indictments against the railway company? If an indictment was returned against the railway company, and was about to be tried by a petit jury, why could not the Federal court, upon the principles now announced, forbid the jury to proceed against the railway company, and if it did, punish every petit juryman as for contempt of court? Indeed, why may it not lay its hands on the Governor of the State and *180 forbid him from appealing to the courts of Minnesota in the name of the State to test the validity of the act in question? And why may not the Federal court lay its hands even upon the judge of the state court itself, whenever it proceeds against the railway company under the state law?
The subject matter of these questions has evidently been considered by this court, and the startling consequences that would result from an affirmative answer to them have not been overlooked; for, in its opinion, I find these observations: ""It is proper to add that the right to enjoin an individual, even though a state official, from commencing suits under circumstances already stated, does not include the power to restrain a court from acting in any case brought before it, either of a civil or criminal nature, nor does it include power to prevent any investigation or action by a grand jury. The latter body is part of the machinery of a criminal court, and an injunction against a state court would be a violation of the whole scheme of our government. If an injunction against an individual is disobeyed, and he commences proceedings before a grand jury or in a court, such disobedience is personal only, and the court or jury can proceed without incurring any penalty on that account. The difference between the power to enjoin an individual from doing certain things, and the power to enjoin courts from proceeding in their own way to exercise jurisdiction is plain, and no power to do the latter exists because of a power to do the former."" If an order of the Federal court forbidding a state court or its grand jury from attempting to enforce a state enactment would be ""a violation of the whole scheme of our government,"" it is difficult to perceive why an order of that court, forbidding the chief law officer and all the district attorneys of a State to represent it in the courts, in a particular case, and practically, in that way, closing the doors of the state court against the State, would not also be inconsistent with the whole scheme of our government, and, therefore, beyond the power of the court to make.
*181 Whether the Minnesota statutes are or are not violative of the Constitution is not, as already suggested, a question in this habeas corpus proceeding. I do not, therefore, stop to consider whether those statutes are repugnant to the Constitution upon the ground that by their necessary operation, when enforced, they will prevent the railway company from contesting their validity, or upon the ground that they are confiscatory and therefore obnoxious to the requirement of due process of law. While the argument at the bar in support of each of these propositions was confessedly of great force and persuasiveness, those points need not be now examined. I express no opinion about them. Their soundness may, however, be conceded for the purposes of this discussion. Indeed, it may be assumed for the purposes of this discussion that these state enactments are harsh and intemperate and, in some of their features, invalid. But those questions are wholly apart from the present proceeding. If we now consider them we must go out of our way in order to do so. We have no evidence in this proceeding, as to the effect which the statutes, if enforced, would have upon the value either of the railway property or of the bonds or stocks of the railway company. The question of their validity has not been finally decided by the Circuit Court, and we have not before us even the evidence upon which its preliminary injunction was based. The essential and only question now before us or that need be decided is whether an order by the Federal court which prevents the State from being represented in its own courts, by its chief law officer, upon an issue involving the constitutional validity of certain state enactments, does not make a suit against the State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment. If it be a suit of that kind, then, it is conceded, the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to fine and imprison the petitioner and he must be discharged, whatever our views may be as to the validity of those state enactments. This must necessarily be so unless the Amendment has less force and a more restricted meaning now than it had at the time of its adoption, *182 and unless a suit against the Attorney General of a State, in his official capacity, is not one against a State under the Eleventh Amendment when its determination depends upon a question of constitutional power or right under the Fourteenth Amendment. In that view I cannot concur. In my opinion the Eleventh Amendment has not been modified in the slightest degree as to its scope or meaning by the Fourteenth Amendment, and a suit which, in its essence, is one against the State remains one of that character and is forbidden even when brought to strike down a state statute alleged to be in violation of that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbidding the deprivation by a State of life, liberty or property without due process of law. If a suit be commenced in a state court, and involves a right secured by the Federal Constitution, the way is open under our incomparable judicial system to protect that right, first, by the judgment of the state court, and ultimately by the judgment of this court, upon writ of error. But such right cannot be protected by means of a suit which, at the outset, is, directly or in legal effect, one against the State whose action is alleged to be illegal. That mode of redress is absolutely forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment and cannot be made legal by mere construction, or by any consideration of the consequences that may follow from the operation of the statute. Parties cannot, in any case, obtain redress by a suit against the State. Such has been the uniform ruling in this court, and it is most unfortunate that it is now declared to be competent for a Federal Circuit Court, by exerting its authority over the chief law officer of the State, without the consent of the State, to exclude the State, in its sovereign capacity, from its own courts when seeking to have the ruling of those courts as to its powers under its own statutes. Surely, the right of a State to invoke the jurisdiction of its own courts is not less than the right of individuals to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court. The preservation of the dignity and sovereignty of the States, within the limits of their constitutional powers, *183 is of the last importance, and vital to the preservation of our system of government. The courts should not permit themselves to be driven by the hardships, real or supposed, of particular cases to accomplish results, even if they be just results, in a mode forbidden by the fundamental law. The country should never be allowed to think that the Constitution can, in any case, be evaded or amended by mere judicial interpretation, or that its behests may be nullified by an ingenious construction of its provisions.
The importance of the question under consideration is a sufficient justification for such a reference to the authorities as will indicate the precise grounds on which this court has oftentimes proceeded when determining what is and what is not a suit against a State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment. All the cases agree in declaring the incapacity of a Federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a State as a party. But assaults upon the Eleventh Amendment have oftenest been made in cases in which the effort has been, without making the State a formal party, to control the acts of its officers and agents, by such orders directed to them as will accomplish, by indirection, the same results that could be accomplished by a suit directly against the State, if such a suit were possible. It will be well to look at some of the principal adjudged cases.
The general question was examined in Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R.R. Co., 109 U.S. 446-451, where the court said that it was conceded in all the cases, and ""may be accepted as a point of departure unquestioned, that neither a State nor the United States can be sued as defendant in any court in this country without their consent, except in the limited class of cases in which a State may be made a party in the Supreme Court of the United States by virtue of the original jurisdiction conferred on this court by the Constitution."" The court has not in any case departed from this constitutional principle. In Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1, 9, it said that ""this immunity of a State from suit is *184 absolute and unqualified, and the constitutional provision securing it is not to be so construed as to place the State within the reach of the process of the court. Accordingly, it is equally well settled that a suit against the officers of a State, to compel them to do the acts which constitute a performance by it of its contracts, is, in effect, a suit against the State itself."" In Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R.R. Co., just cited, the distinction was drawn between a suit in which the State is the real party in interest, although not technically a party on the record, and one in which ""an individual is sued in tort for some act injurious to another in regard to person or property, to which his defense is that he has acted under the orders of the government;"" in which last case, the court observed, the defendant ""is not sued as, or because he is, the officer of the government, but as an individual, and the court is not ousted of jurisdiction because he asserts authority as such officer."" Let it not be forgotten that the defendant Young was sued, not as an individual or because he had any personal interest in these matters, but as, and solely because he is, an officer of the State charged with the performance of certain public duties.
In Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52, 67, 68, which involved the validity of certain scrip alleged to have been issued by the State of South Carolina, it appeared that the State having denied its obligation to pay, the plaintiff sought relief by simply suing certain state officers, as such, without making the State a formal party. The court said: ""These suits are accurately described as bills for the specific performance of a contract between the complainants and the State of South Carolina, who are the only parties to it. But to these bills the State is not in name made a party defendant, though leave is given to it to become such, if it chooses; and, except with that consent, it could not be brought before the court and be made to appear and defend. And yet it is the actual party to the alleged contract the performance of which is decreed, the one required to perform the decree, and the only *185 party by whom it can be performed. Though not nominally a party to the record, it is the real and only party in interest, the nominal defendants being the officers and agents of the State, having no personal interest in the subject-matter of the suit, and defending only as representing the State. And the things required by the decrees to be done and performed by them, are the very things, which when done and performed, constitute a performance of the alleged contract by the State. The State is not only the real party to the controversy, but the real party against which relief is sought by the suit, and the suit is, therefore, substantially within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which declares that `the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State.'"" Again: ""If this case is not within the class of those forbidden by the constitutional guaranty to the State of immunity from suits in Federal tribunals, it is difficult to conceive the frame of one which would be. If the State is named as a defendant, it can only be reached either by mesne or final process through its officers and agents, and a judgment against it could neither be obtained nor enforced, except as the public conduct and government of the ideal political body called a State could be reached and affected through its official representatives. A judgment against these latter, in their official and representative capacity, commanding them to perform official functions on behalf of the State according to the dictates and decrees of the court, is, if anything can be, a judicial proceeding against the State itself. If not, it may well be asked, what would constitute such a proceeding? In the present cases the decrees were not only against the defendants in their official capacity, but, that there might be no mistake as to the nature and extent of the duty to be performed, also against their successors in office."" Is it to be said that an order requiring the Attorney General of a *186 State to perform certain official functions on behalf of the State is a suit against the State, while an order forbidding him, as Attorney General, not to perform an official function on behalf of the State is not a suit against the State?
The leading case upon the general subject, and one very similar in many important particulars to the present one, is In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 496, 497, 505. The facts in that case were briefly these: The legislature of Virginia, in 1887, passed an act which holders of sundry bonds and tax-receivable coupons of that Commonwealth alleged to be in violation of their rights under the Constitution of the United States. They instituted a suit in equity in the Circuit Court of the United States against the Attorney General and Auditor of Virginia, and against the Treasurers and Commonwealth attorneys of counties, cities and towns in Virginia, the relief asked being a decree enjoining and restraining the said state officers, and each of them, from bringing or commencing any suit provided for by the above act of 1887, or from doing anything to put that act into operation. The Circuit Court entered an order, enjoining the Attorney General of Virginia and each and all the state officers named ""from bringing or commencing any suit against any person who has tendered the State of Virginia tax-receivable coupons in payment of taxes due to said State, as provided for and directed by the act of the legislature of Virginia, approved May 12, 1887."" Subsequently the Circuit Court of the United States was informed that the Attorney General of Virginia had disobeyed its order of injunction. Thereupon that officer was ruled to show cause why he should not be fined and imprisoned. He responded to the rule, admitting that after being served with the injunction he had instituted a suit, in the state Circuit Court, against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to recover taxes due the State, and alleging ""that he instituted the said suit because he was thereunto required by the act of the General Assembly of Virginia aforesaid, and because he believed this court had no jurisdiction whatever to award the injunction *187 violated."" He disclaimed any intention to treat the court with disrespect, and stated that he had been actuated alone by the desire to have the law properly administered. He was, nevertheless, adjudged guilty of contempt, was required forthwith to dismiss the suit he had brought, was fined $500 for contempt of court, and committed to the custody of the marshal until the fine was paid, and until he purged himself of his contempt by dismissing the suit in the state court. The Attorney General then applied directly to this court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted, and upon hearing he was released by this court from custody. The order for his discharge recited that the suit in which the injunctions were granted was ""in substance and in law a suit against the State of Virginia,"" and ""within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution;"" that it was one ""to which the judicial power of the United States does not extend;"" that the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it; that all its proceedings in the exercise of jurisdiction were null and void; that it had no authority or power to adjudge the Attorney General in contempt; and that his imprisonment was without authority of law. In the opinion in the Ayers case the court said: ""It follows, therefore, in the present case, that the personal act of the petitioners sought to be restrained by the order of the Circuit Court, reduced to the mere bringing of an action in the name of and for the State against taxpayers, who, although they may have tendered tax-receivable coupons, are charged as delinquents, cannot be alleged against them as an individual act in violation of any legal or contract rights of such taxpayers."" Again: ""The relief sought is against the defendants, not in their individual, but in their representative capacity as officers of the State of Virginia. The acts sought to be restrained are the bringing of suits by the State of Virginia in its own name and for its own use. If the State had been made a defendant to this bill by name, charged according to the allegations it now contains — supposing that such a suit could be maintained — it would have been subject *188 to the jurisdiction of the court by process served upon its Governor and Attorney General, according to the precedents in such cases. New Jersey v. New York, 5 Pet. 284, 288, 290; Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 96, 97; Rule 5 of 1884, 108 U.S. 574. If a decree could have been rendered enjoining the State from bringing suits against its taxpayers, it would have operated upon the State only through the officers who by law were required to represent it in bringing such suits, viz., the present defendants, its Attorney General, and the Commonwealth's attorneys for the several counties. For a breach of such an injunction, these officers would be amenable to the court as proceeding in contempt of its authority, and would be liable to punishment thereof by attachment and imprisonment. The nature of the case, as supposed, is identical with that of the case as actually presented in the bill, with the single exception that the State is not named as a defendant. How else can the State be forbidden by judicial process to bring actions in its name, except by constraining the conduct of its officers, its attorneys, and its agents? And if all such officers, attorneys, and agents are personally subjected to the process of the court, so as to forbid their acting in its behalf, how can it be said that the State itself is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the court as an actual and real defendant?"" Further: ""The very object and purpose of the Eleventh Amendment were to prevent the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties. It was thought to be neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had not been delegated to the United States, should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of private persons, whether citizens of other States or aliens, or that the course of their public policy and the administration of their public affairs should be subject to and controlled by the members of judicial tribunals without their consent, and in favor of individual interests. To secure the manifest purposes of the constitutional exemption guaranteed *189 by the Eleventh Amendment requires that it should be interpreted, not literally and too narrowly, but fairly, and with such breadth and largeness as effectually to accomplish the substance of its purpose. In this spirit it must be held to cover, not only suits brought against a State by name, but those also against its officers, agents and representatives where the State, though not named as such, is nevertheless the only real party against which alone in fact the relief is asked, and against which the judgment or decree effectively operates. But this is not intended in any way to impinge upon the principle which justifies suits against individual defendants, who, under color of the authority of unconstitutional legislation by the State, are guilty of personal trespasses and wrongs, nor to forbid suits against officers in their official capacity either to arrest or direct their official action by injunction or mandamus, where such suits are authorized by law, and the act to be done or omitted is purely ministerial, in the performance or omission of which the plaintiff has a legal interest.""
It is said that the Ayers case is not applicable here, because the orders made by the Federal Circuit Court had for their object to compel Virginia to perform its contract with bondholders, which is not this case. But that difference between the Ayers case and this case cannot affect the principle involved. The proceeding against the Attorney General of Virginia had for its object to compel, by indirection, the performance of the contract which that Commonwealth was alleged to have made with bondholders — such performance, on the part of the State, to be effected by means of orders in a Federal Circuit Court directly controlling the official action of that officer. The proceeding in the Perkins-Shepard suit against the Attorney General of Minnesota had for its object, by means of orders in a Federal Circuit Court, directed to that officer, to control the action of that State in reference to the enforcement of certain statutes by judicial proceedings commenced in its own courts. The relief sought in each case was to control the State by controlling the conduct of its law-officer, *190 against its will. I cannot conceive how the proceeding against the Attorney General of Virginia could be deemed a suit against that State, and yet the proceeding against the Attorney General of Minnesota is not to be deemed a suit against Minnesota, when the object and effect of the latter proceeding was, beyond all question, to shut that State entirely out of its own courts, and prevent it through its law-officer from invoking their jurisdiction in a special matter of public concern, involving official duty, about which the State desired to know the views of its own judiciary. In my opinion the decision in the Ayers case determines this case for the petitioner.
More directly in point, perhaps, for the petitioner Young is the case of Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516, 528, 529, 530. That suit was brought by the receivers of a railroad company against the Governor and Attorney General of Alabama. Its object was to prevent the enforcement of the provisions of an Alabama statute prescribing the maximum rates of toll to be charged on a certain bridge across the Tennessee River. The statute imposed a penalty for each time that the owners, lessees or operators of the bridge demanded or received any higher rate of toll than was prescribed by it. The relief asked was an injunction prohibiting the Governor and Attorney General of the State and all other persons from instituting any proceeding against the complainants, or either of them, to enforce the statute. An injunction, as prayed for, was granted. In the progress of the cause the solicitor of the district in which the case was pending was made a defendant and the injunction was extended to him. By amended pleadings it was made to appear that the tollgate keepers at the public crossing of the bridge were indicted for collecting tolls in violation of the statute. In the progress of the cause the plaintiffs dismissed the case as to the State, and the cause was discontinued as to the Governor. But the case was heard upon the motion to dismiss the bill upon the ground that the suit was one against the State in violation of the Constitution of the United States.
*191 After stating the principles settled in the Ayers case and in other cases this court said: ""If these principles be applied in the present case there is no escape from the conclusion that, although the State of Alabama was dismissed as a party defendant, this suit against its officers is really one against the State. As a State can act only by its officers, an order restraining those officers from taking any steps, by means of judicial proceedings, in execution of the statute of February 9, 1895, is one which restrains the State itself, and the suit is consequently as much against the State as if the State were named as a party defendant on the record. If the individual defendants held possession or were about to take possession of, or to commit any trespass upon, any property belonging to or under the control of the plaintiffs, in violation of the latter's constitutional rights, they could not resist the judicial determination, in a suit against them, of the question of the right to such possession by simply asserting that they held or were entitled to hold the property in their capacity as officers of the State. In the case supposed, they would be compelled to make good the State's claim to the property, and could not shield themselves against suit because of their official character. Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204, 222. No such case is before us."" Again, in the same case: ""It is to be observed that neither the Attorney General of Alabama nor the Solicitor of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of the State appear to have been charged by law with any special duty in connection with the act of February 9, 1895. In support of the contention that the present suit is not one against the State, reference was made by counsel to several cases, among which were Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270; Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, 114 U.S. 311; Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1; In re Tyler, 149 U.S. 164; Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U.S. 362, 388; Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, and Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S. 466. Upon examination it will be found that the defendants in each of those cases were officers of the State, especially charged with the execution of a state enactment *192 alleged to be unconstitutional, but under the authority of which, it was averred, they were committing or were about to commit some specific wrong or trespass to the injury of the plaintiff's rights. There is a wide difference between a suit against individuals, holding official positions under a State, to prevent them, under the sanction of an unconstitutional statute, from committing by some positive act a wrong or trespass, and a suit against officers of a State merely to test the constitutionality of a state statute, in the enforcement of which those officers will act only by formal judicial proceedings in the courts of the State. In the present case, as we have said, neither of the state officers named held any special relation to the particular statute alleged to be unconstitutional. They were not expressly directed to see to its enforcement. If, because they were law officers of the State, a case could be made for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the statute, by an injunction suit brought against them, then the constitutionality of every act passed by the legislature could be tested by a suit against the Governor and Attorney General, based upon the theory that the former as the executive of the State was, in a general sense, charged with the execution of all its laws, and the latter, as Attorney General, might represent the State in litigation involving the enforcement of its statutes. That would be a very convenient way for obtaining a speedy judicial determination of questions of constitutional law which may be raised by individuals, but it is a mode which cannot be applied to the States of the Union consistently with the fundamental principle that they cannot, without their assent, be brought into any court at the suit of private persons. If their officers commit acts of trespass or wrong to the citizen, they may be individually proceeded against for such trespasses or wrong. Under the view we take of the question, the citizen is not without effective remedy, when proceeded against under a legislative enactment void for repugnancy to the supreme law of the land; for, whatever the form of proceeding against him, he can make his defense upon the *193 ground that the statute is unconstitutional and void. And that question can be ultimately brought to this court for final determination."" I am unable to distinguish that case, in principle, from the one now before us. The Fitts case is not overruled, but is, I fear, frittered away or put out of sight by unwarranted distinctions.
Two cases in this court are much relied on to support the proposition that the Perkins-Shepard suit in the Circuit Court is not a suit against the State. I refer to Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U.S. 362, and Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S. 466, 472. But each of those cases differs in material respects from the one instituted by Perkins and Shepard in the court below. In the Reagan case it appears that the very act, under which the railroad commission proceeded, authorized the railroad company, or any interested party, if dissatisfied with the action of the commission in establishing rates, to bring suit against that commission in any court, in a named county, with right to appeal to a higher court. This court when combating the suggestion that only the state court had jurisdiction to proceed against the commission, and give relief in respect of the rates it established, said: ""It may be laid down as a general proposition that, whenever a citizen of a State can go into the courts of a State to defend his property against the illegal acts of its officers, a citizen of another State may invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to maintain a like defense. A State cannot tie up a citizen of another State, having property rights within its territory invaded by unauthorized acts of its own officers, to suits for redress in its own courts. Given a case where a suit can be maintained in the courts of the State to protect property rights, a citizen of another State may invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. . . . It comes, therefore, within the very terms of the act. It cannot be doubted that a State, like any other government, can waive exemption from suit."" The declaration of the court in the Reagan case, that that suit was not, within the true meaning of the Eleventh *194 Amendment, to be regarded as a suit against the State, must therefore be taken in connection with the declaration in the same case that the State having consented that the commission might be sued in one of its own courts, in respect of the rates established by the statute, must be taken to have waived its immunity from suit in the Circuit Court of the United States sitting in Texas. In Smyth v. Ames, above cited, which was a suit in a Circuit Court of the United States, involving the constitutional validity of certain rates established for railroads in Nebraska, it appeared that the statute expressly authorized any railroad company claiming that the rates were unreasonable to bring an action against the State before the Supreme Court in the name of the railroad company or companies bringing the same. Thus the State of Nebraska waived its immunity from suit, and having authorized a suit against itself in one of its courts, in respect of the rates there in question, it could not, according to the decision in the Reagan case, deny its liability to like suit in a court of the United States. It is true that this court, in its opinion in Smyth v. Ames, did not lay any special stress on the fact that Nebraska, by the statute, agreed that it might be sued, but it took especial care in its extended statement of the case to bring out that fact. Its silence on that point is not extraordinary, in view of the fact, as appears from the opinion of this court, that the question whether that suit was to be deemed one against the State was not discussed at the bar by the Nebraska State Board. We there quoted from the Reagan case these words: ""Whenever a citizen of a State can go into the courts of a State to defend his property against the illegal acts of its officers, a citizen of another State may invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to maintain a like defense. A State cannot tie up a citizen of another State, having property rights within its territory invaded by unauthorized acts of its own officers, to suits for redress in its own courts."" That the Reagan and Smyth cases did not go as far as is now claimed for them is made clear by the later case of Fitts v. McGhee, already referred *195 to, in which the doctrines of In re Ayers were reaffirmed and applied.
We may refer in this connection to Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U.S. 273, 291, in which case one of the points made was that the Circuit Court of the United States had no power to restrain the Attorney General of South Carolina and the counsel associated with him from prosecuting in the state courts actions authorized by the laws of the State, and hence that the court erred in awarding an injunction against said officers. This court said: ""Support for the proposition is rested upon the terms of the Eleventh Amendment and the provisions of section 720 of the Revised Statutes, forbidding the granting of a writ by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy. The soundness of the doctrine relied upon is undoubted. In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443; Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516. The difficulty is that the doctrine is inapplicable to this case. Section 720 of the Revised Statutes was originally adopted in 1793, whilst the Eleventh Amendment was in process of formation in Congress for submission to the States, and long, therefore, before the ratification of that Amendment. The restrictions embodied in the section were, therefore, but a partial accomplishment of the more comprehensive result affectuated by the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment. Both the statute and the Amendment relate to the power of courts of the United States to deal, against the will and consent of a State, with controversies between it and individuals. None of the prohibitions, therefore, of the Amendment or of the statute relate to the power of a Federal court to administer relief in causes where jurisdiction as to a State and its officers has been acquired as a result of the voluntary action of the State in submitting its rights to judicial determination. To confound the two classes of cases is but to overlook the distinction which exists between the power of a court to deal with a subject over which it has *196 jurisdiction and its want of authority to entertain a controversy as to which jurisdiction is not possessed.""
Counsel for the railway company placed some reliance on Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1, 18, in which the previous cases on the general subject of suits against the States were classified. That case was a suit in equity against certain parties ""who, under the constitution of Oregon, as Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer of that State, comprised the Board of Land Commissioners of that State, to restrain and enjoin them from selling and conveying a large amount of land in that State, to which the plaintiff asserted title."" That suit, in view of the nature of the relief asked, and of the relations of the defendants to the matters involved, was held not to be one against the State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment. But after a review of the facts the court, as explanatory of the conclusion reached by it, took especial care to observe: ""In this connection it must be borne in mind that this suit is not nominally against the Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer, as such officers, but against them collectively, as the board of land commissioners."" The present suit is, in terms, against Young ""as Attorney General of Minnesota,"" and the decree was sought against him, as such officer, not against him individually, or as a mere administrative officer charged with certain duties.
One of the cases cited in support of the decision now rendered is Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Missouri R.R. & Warehouse Commissioners, 183 U.S. 53, 58, 59. But although that particular suit was held not to be one against the State, the case, in respect of the principles announced by the court, is in harmony with the views I have expressed. For, the court there says: ""Was the State the real party plaintiff? It was at an early day held by this court, construing the Eleventh Amendment, that in all cases where jurisdiction depends on the party, it is the party named in the record. Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat. 738. But that technical construction has yielded to one more in consonance with the *197 spirit of the Amendment, and in In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, it was ruled upon full consideration that the Amendment covers not only suits against a State by name but those also against its officers, agents and representatives where the State, though not named as such, is nevertheless the only real party against which in fact the relief is asked, and against which the judgment or decree effectively operates. And that construction of the Amendment has since been followed."" In the present case, the State, although not named on the record as a party, is the real party whose action it is sought to control.
There are other cases in this court in which the scope and meaning of the Eleventh Amendment were under consideration, but they need not be cited, for they are well known. They are all cited in In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 500. ""The vital principle in all such cases,"" this court said in the Ayers case, ""is that the defendants, though professing to act as officers of the State, are threatening a violation of the personal or property rights of the complainant, for which they are personally and individually liable,"" or cases in which the officer sued refused to perform a purely ministerial duty, about which he had no discretion and in the performance of which the plaintiff had a direct interest. The case before us is altogether different. The statutes in question did not impose upon the Attorney General of Minnesota any special duty to see to their enforcement. In bringing the mandamus suit he acted under the general authority inhering in him as the chief law officer of his State. He could not become personally liable to the railway company simply because of his bringing the mandamus suit. The Attorney General stated that all he did, or contemplated doing, was to bring the mandamus suit. The mere bringing of such a suit could not be alleged against him as an individual in violation of any legal right of the railway company or its shareholders. In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 496. The plaintiffs recognized this fact and hence did not proceed in their suit upon the ground that the defendant was individually liable. They sued him only as Attorney General, *198 and sought a decree against him in his official capacity, not otherwise.
Some reference has been made to Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, and other cases, that affirm the authority of a Federal court, under existing statutes, to discharge upon habeas corpus from the custody of a state officer one who is held in violation of the Federal Constitution for an alleged crime against a State. Those cases are not at all in point in the present discussion. Such a habeas corpus proceeding is ex parte, having for its object only to inquire whether the applicant for the writ is illegally restrained of his liberty. If he is, then the state officer holding him in custody is a trespasser, and cannot defend the wrong or tort committed by him, by pleading his official character. The power in a Federal court to discharge a person from the custody of a trespasser may well exist, and yet the court has no power in a suit before it, by an order directed against the Attorney General of a State, as such, to prevent the State from being represented by that officer, as a litigant in one of its own courts. The former cases, it may be argued, come within the decisions which hold that a suit which only seeks to prevent or restrain a trespass upon property or person by one who happens to be a state officer, but is proceeding in violation of the Constitution of the United States, is not a suit against a State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, but a suit against the trespasser or wrongdoer. But the authority of the Federal court to protect one against a trespass committed or about to be committed by a state officer in violation of the Constitution of the United States is very different from the power now asserted, and recognized by this court as existing, to shut out a sovereign State from its own courts by the device of forbidding its Attorney General, under the penalty of fine and imprisonment, from appearing in such courts in its behalf. The mere bringing of a suit on behalf of a State, by its Attorney General, cannot (this court has decided in the Ayers case) make that officer a trespasser and individually liable to the *199 party sued. To enjoin him from representing the State in such suit is therefore, for every practical or legal purpose, to enjoin the State itself. This court, in the Debs Case, 158 U.S. 564, 584, said: ""Every government, entrusted, by the very terms of its being, with powers and duties to be exercised and discharged for the general welfare, has a right to apply to its own courts for any proper assistance in the exercise of the one and the discharge of the other, and it is no sufficient answer to its appeal to one of those courts that it has no pecuniary interest in the matter. The obligation which it is under to promote the interest of all, and to prevent the wrongdoing of one resulting in injury to the general welfare, is often of itself sufficient to give it a standing in court. This proposition in some of its relations has heretofore received the sanction of this court."" If there be one power that a State possesses, which ought to be deemed beyond the control, in any mode, of the National Government or of any of its courts, it is the power by judicial proceedings to appear in its own courts, by its law-officer or by attorneys, and seek the guidance of those courts in respect of matters of a justiciable nature. If the state court, by its judgment, in such a suit, should disregard the injunctions of the Federal Constitution, that judgment would be subject to review by this court upon writ of error or appeal.
It will be well now to look at the course of decisions in other Federal courts.
Attention is first directed to Arbuckle v. Blackburn, 113 Fed. Rep. 616, 622, which was a suit in equity, one of the principal objects of which was to restrain the enforcement of an act of the Ohio legislature relating to food products, particularly of a named coffee in which the plaintiffs were interested. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the bill was properly dismissed, saying, among other things: ""What, then, is the object of the injunction sought in this case? It is no more or less than to restrain the officer of the State from bringing prosecutions for violations of an act which said officer *200 is expressly charged to enforce in the only way he is authorized to proceed — by bringing criminal prosecutions in the name of the State. This is virtually to enjoin the State from proceeding through its duly qualified and acting officers. If the food commissioner may be enjoined from instituting such prosecutions, why may not the prosecuting attorney, or any officer of the State charged with the execution of the criminal laws of the State? While the State may not be sued, if the bill can be sustained against its officers, it is as effectually prevented from proceeding to enforce its laws as it would be by an action directly against the State. This view of the case, in our judgment, is amply sustained by the cases above cited, and by the later case of Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516. In so far as this action seeks an injunction against the respondent from proceeding to enforce by prosecution the provisions of the statutes of Ohio above cited, the courts of the United States are deprived of jurisdiction by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.""
In Union Trust Co. v. Stearns, 119 Fed. Rep. 790, 791, 792, 795, the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Rhode Island had occasion to consider the scope of the Eleventh Amendment. The case related to a statute regulating the hours of labor of certain employes of street railways, and imposing a fine for a violation of its provisions. The court upon an elaborate review of all the cases in this court dismissed the action. The defendants Stearns and Greenough were, respectively, the Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General of the State. They were not named in the act, nor charged with any special duty in connection therewith. The court said: ""The purpose of the present bill, in substance and effect, is to enjoin the State of Rhode Island from the enforcement of a penal statute. Indictments under the act are brought in the name and on behalf of the State for the protection of the State. These defendants, the Attorney General and his assistant, merely represent the State in such proceedings. They are simply the officers and agents of the State. It is not as *201 individuals, but solely by virtue of their holding such offices, that they prefer and prosecute indictments in the name of the State. A State can only act or be proceeded against through its officers. If a decree could be entered against the State of Rhode Island enjoining prosecutions under this act, it could only operate against the State through enjoining these defendants. An order restraining the Attorney General and his assistant from the enforcement of this statute is an order restraining the State itself. The present suit, therefore, is as much against the State of Rhode Island as if the State itself were named a party defendant."" After referring to In re Ayers, and Fitts v. McGhee, and upon a review of the cases, the court proceeded: ""The defendants Stearns and Greenough hold no special relation to the act of June 1, 1902. They are not specially charged with its execution. They are not thereby constituted a board or commission with administrative powers, nor are they as individuals, and apart from the official authority under which they act, threatening to seize the property of the complainant, or to commit any wrong or trespass against its personal or property rights. They have no other connection with this statute than the institution of formal judicial proceedings for its enforcement in the courts of the State in the name and behalf of the State. Upon reason and authority the present bill is a suit against the State of Rhode Island, within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.""
In Morenci Copper Co. v. Freer, 127 Fed. Rep. 199, 205, which was an action in equity to restrain and inhibit the defendant, in his official capacity as Attorney General of West Virginia, from proceeding to institute an action in the state court for forfeiture of the charter of the plaintiff corporation for a failure to pay a license tax imposed by a state statute, and which statute was alleged to be in violation of the Federal Constitution, the Circuit Court reviewed the decisions of this court upon the question as to what were and what were not suits against the State. The Circuit Court held that it had no jurisdiction *202 of the case, saying: ""But it may be said, if the court holds that no remedy of this sort will lie in the Circuit Court of the United States to prevent this breach of a contract by the State of West Virginia by means of the machinery of a law violative of the Constitution of the United States, how are the rights of corporations to be preserved? The answer is that such alleged unconstitutionality is matter of defense to any suit brought for the forfeiture of complainant's charter, and could be set up as an answer and defense to any bill brought for that purpose, and, if the highest court of the State ruled adversely to that contention, appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of the United States. Or the case can be removed to the Circuit Court of the United States if it presents a case arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.""
A well-considered case is that of Western Union Tel. Co. v. Andrews, 154 Fed. Rep. 95, 107. In that case the telegraph company sought by bill, to enjoin the prosecuting attorneys of the various judicial circuits of Arkansas from instituting any proceeding for penalties for its failure or refusal to comply with the provisions of an act of the legislature of Arkansas relating to foreign corporations doing business in that State and fixing fees, etc. The bill charged that the various prosecuting attorneys would, unless restrained, institute numerous actions for the recovery of the penalties prescribed by the act, which was no less than $1,000 for each alleged violation. The defense was, among other things, that the action was one against the State, and, therefore, prohibited by the Constitution. After a careful review of the adjudged cases in this court and in the subordinate Federal courts, the Circuit Court held the action to be one against the State, forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment, saying among other things: ""The allegations in the bill show that this is an attempt to prevent the State of Arkansas, through its officers, who by its laws are merely its attorneys, to represent it in all legal actions in its favor or in which it is interested, from instituting and prosecuting suits for the recovery of penalties incurred for alleged *203 violation of its laws, actions which can only be instituted in the name of the State and for its use and benefit.""
Upon the fullest consideration and after a careful examination of the authorities, my mind has been brought to the conclusion that no case heretofore determined by this court requires us to hold that the Federal Circuit Court had authority to forbid the Attorney General of Minnesota from representing the State in the mandamus suit in the state court, or to adjudge that he was in contempt and liable to be fined and imprisoned simply because of his having, as Attorney General, brought that suit for the State in one of its courts. On the contrary, my conviction is very strong that, if regard be had to former utterances of this court, the suit of Perkins and Shepard in the Federal court, in respect of the relief sought therein against Young, in his official capacity, as Attorney General of Minnesota, is to be deemed — under the Ayers and Fitts cases particularly — a suit against the State of which the Circuit Court of the United States could not take cognizance without violating the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution. Even if it were held that suits to restrain the instituting of actions directly to recover the prescribed penalties would not be suits against the State, it would not follow that we should go further and hold that a proceeding under which the State was, in effect, denied access, by its Attorney General, to its own courts, would be consistent with the Eleventh Amendment. A different view means, as I think, that although the judicial power of the United States does not extend to any suit expressly brought against a State by a citizen of another State without its consent or to any suit the legal effect of which is to tie the hands of the State, although not formally named as a party, yet a Circuit Court of the United States, in a suit brought against the Attorney General of a State may, by orders directed specifically against that officer, control, entirely control, by indirection, the action of the State itself in judicial proceedings in its own courts involving the constitutional validity of its statutes. This court has heretofore held that *204 that could not be done, and that such a result would, for most purposes, practically obliterate the Eleventh Amendment and place the States, in vital particulars, as absolutely under the control of the subordinate Federal courts, as if they were capable of being directly sued. I put the matter in this way, because to forbid the Attorney General of a State (under the penalty of being punished as for contempt) from representing his State in suits of a particular kind, in its own courts, is to forbid the State itself from appearing and being heard in such suits. Neither the words nor the policy of the Eleventh Amendment will, under our former decisions, justify any order of a Federal court the necessary effect of which will be to exclude a State from its own courts. Such an order attended by such results cannot, I submit, be sustained consistently with the powers which the States, according to the uniform declarations of this court, possess under the Constitution. I am justified, by what this court has heretofore declared, in now saying that the men who framed the Constitution and who caused the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment would have been amazed by the suggestion that a State of the Union can be prevented by an order of a subordinate Federal court from being represented by its Attorney General in a suit brought by it in one of its own courts; and that such an order would be inconsistent with the dignity of the States as involved in their constitutional immunity from the judicial process of the Federal courts (except in the limited cases in which they may constitutionally be made parties in this court) and would be attended by most pernicious results.
I dissent from the opinion and judgment.

Beginnings/Colour My World,chicago,1971,1970,"I’m going to first explain a few things about myself. I’m 52-years-old, I have been in bands continuously, and active in the music scene in one way or another since about 1978. At the moment I’m in a band, I also work as a recording engineer and I own a recording studio in Chicago. In the past I have also been a fanzine writer, radio club DJ, concert promoter and I ran a small record label. I was not terribly successful at any of those things, but I have done them, so they qualify as part of my CV.
I work every day with music and with bands and I have for more than 30 years. I’ve made a couple thousand records for independent bands and rock stars, for big labels and small ones. I made a record two days ago and I’ll be making one on Monday when I get off the plane. So I believe this puts me in a pretty good position to evaluate the state of the music scene today, as it relates to how it used to be and how it has been.
We’re all here to talk about the state of the music scene and the health of the music community. I’ll start by saying that I’m both satisfied and optimistic about the state of the music scene. And I welcome the social and technological changes that have influenced it. I hope my remarks today will start a conversation and through that conversation we can invoke an appreciation of how resilient the music community is, how supportive it can be and how welcoming it should be.
I hear from some of my colleagues that these are rough times: that the internet has cut the legs off the music scene and that pretty soon nobody will be making music anymore because there’s no money in it. Virtually every place where music is written about, there is some version of this troubling perspective. People who used to make a nice income from royalties, they’ve seen the royalties dry up. And people who used to make a living selling records are having trouble selling downloads as substitute for records, and they no longer make records.
So there is a tacit assumption that this money, lost money, needs to be replaced and a lot of energy has been spent arguing from where that money will come. Bitchiness about this abounds, with everybody insisting that somebody else should be paying him, but that he shouldn’t have to pay for anybody else. I would like to see an end to this dissatisfaction.
It’s worthwhile to remember from where we’ve come. From where this bitchiness originates. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the period in which I was most active in bands in the music scene – let’s call this the pre-internet era. The music industry was essentially the record industry, in that records and radio were the venues through which people learned of music and principally experienced it. They were joined by MTV and videos in the 80s and 90s, but the principle relationship people had with music was as sound recordings. There was a booming band scene and all bands aspired to getting recorded, as a mark of legitimacy.
But recording was a rare and expensive enterprise, so it wasn’t common. Even your demo tape required considerable investment. So when I started playing in bands in the 70s and 80s most bands went through their entire lifecycle without so much as a note of their music ever being recorded.
Now I’m going to describe the scene as I observed it in America, but I understand that most of the structures and conditions I observed have parallels in other markets. Maybe somebody from my generation can add the local Aussie colour to my comments – I prefer them shouted in as thick an accent as you can muster.
As a yardstick for the economics of the day or for the era, in 1979 you could buy a 45rpm single for a buck, a new album for $5, go see a club gig for $1 or a stadium gig for $7. I know these things because I still have some old ticket stubs and price stickers on my records. Note the relative parity between the live show costs and the recorded music costs. A gradual inflation of prices remained under way through the 90s, making recorded music more expensive, though it remained the principal means of experience.
The whole industry depended on these sales, and sales depended on exposure. Bands on big labels toured, essentially to promote their recordings. And the labels provided promotional and logistical support to keep the bands on the road. This supported a network of agents and managers and roadies and promotional staff, so the expense was considerable.
Retail outlets also offered special placements and promotion: displays, posters, mentions in print ads, giveaways, trinkets and what were called end cap displays. Record labels paid handsomely for these promotions and the stores used the sale of these promotions as additional income. Chain stores especially relied on corporate chain-wide promotions, regardless what the stores might think their local clientele might like. It wasn’t uncommon to see big displays of hair metal bands in urban outlets where they couldn’t sell a single stick but the labels had paid for their utility, so up they went.
Radio stations were enormously influential. Radio was the only place to hear music from any people and record companies paid dearly to influence them. Direct payola had been made illegal but this was a trivial workaround. Record pluggers acting as programming consultants were the middlemen. They paid radio stations for access to their programmers and conducted meetings where new records were promoted.
These promotional offers were quite lucrative. But their metrics depended on radio stations recording that they had added the records to their playlist. To satisfy this requirement and keep the promotional money flowing, radio stations often played tiny fragments of songs jumbled one after the other in any incomprehensible flow during late-night programming hours, to satisfy the programming requirement that they add songs to their playlist. Popular radio stations also staged mammoth concerts, often for free or for nominal cover featuring bands that the labels were promoting. These unpaid radio gigs were a drag on their touring income but the promotional value was presumed to be worth it.
Journalists and editors who could place reviews, program directors and independent DJs who could add records to playlists or played in nightclubs, were subject to much buttering up. Promotional trinkets and advance copies of records were sent their way. Sometimes by the box. Presumably these were listening and file copies. But they were actually a bribe. These promotional copies were immediately sold secondhand to record stores and it was not uncommon for such stores to be overstocked with a new release prior to its official release as a result. My wife worked in a record store that bought records secondhand in the 90s. And their biggest repeat customers, by a long shot, were the people on these label promo lists. The staff at her store kept a tally for awhile and the editor of the local weeklies music section made a comfortable second income amounting to a $1,000 or more a month from selling these promo copies.
So it was a leaky system, riddled with inefficiencies, but a lot of people made a living through it. Record store owners, buyers, employees, ad agencies, designers, club owners, label reps, A&R, producers, recording studios, publicists, lawyers, journalists, program directors, distributors, tour managers, booking agents, band managers, and all the ancillary services they required: banking, shipping, printing, photography, travel agencies, limos, spandex wardrobe, cocaine dealers, prostitutes. Because of this great bulk of the industry needed to sustain itself. Every facet of the industry was tailored to this need.
The most significant bit of tailoring was an accounting trick called recouping costs. The costs of making a record wasn’t borne by the record label, except initially. Those costs were recouped or taken out of the income the band might otherwise run as royalties. The same was true of all those promo copies, posters, radio pluggers and payola men, producers, publicists, tour support, 8x10 glossies, shipping, freight – basically anything that could be associated with a specific band or record was ultimately paid for by the band, not by the record label.
As the label shifted from vinyl to CD as the dominant format, the labels could easily sell the CD as a convenient, compact, trouble-free way to listen to music. The profit margin exploded and the money got stupid. Retails costs of a CD was half again or double more than an LP but the manufacturing, shipping and storage costs were a tiny fraction. The labels even used vinyl’s legacy as a tool to increase this profit margin by charging bands for unique packaging, despite the fact that CD packaging was designed to be standardised. Or pre-emptively charging back for broken CDs at a rate implying that someone was attacking the inventory with an axe.
In the end the bands operating under this system earned very little from their record sales, unless they were monumental stars. Often enough bands would conduct their entire careers with a label and never reach the point where they had sufficiently recouped to get paid anything at all. Now the label made its per-piece profit on every record sold. And could recoup the cost of any records unsold. And all those other people got paid using the money that would have otherwise gone to the bands as royalties. Unsurprisingly, those other people also got paid pretty well. It stands to reason that if the label is paying you with someone else’s money, the label doesn’t need to care how much you charge.
During the 90s there was something of an arms race to see who could write the biggest deal. That is, the deal with the most money being spent on the band’s behalf. In a singularly painless contest the money would either be paid to the band as a royalty, which would take that money out of the system and put it into things like houses and groceries and college educations. Or it could be paid to other operators within the industry, increasing the clout and prestige of the person doing the spending. It’s as if your boss, instead of giving your paycheck to you, could pay that money to his friends and business associates, invoking your name as he did. Since his net cost was the same and his friends and associates could return the favour, why would he ever want to let any of that money end up in your hands? It was a system that ensured waste by rewarding the most profligate spendthrifts in a system specifically engineered to waste the band’s money.
Now bands existed outside that label spectrum. The working bands of the type I’ve always been in, and for those bands everything was always smaller and simpler. Promotion was usually down to flyers posted on poles, occasional mentions on college radio and fanzines. If you had booked a gig at a venue that didn’t advertise, then you faced a very real prospect of playing to an empty room. Local media didn’t take bands seriously until there was a national headline about them so you could basically forget about press coverage. And commercial radio was absolutely locked up by the payola-driven system of the pluggers and program directors.
International exposure was extraordinarily expensive. In order for your records to make it into overseas hands you had to convince a distributor to export them. And that was difficult with no means for anyone to hear the record and decide to buy it. So you ended up shipping promotional copies overseas at a terrific expense, never sure if they would be listened to or not.
The one exception to this was the brilliant BBC DJ John Peel. He listened religiously to every single record he received in the mail, devoting hours of every day to the task. I sent him a copy of the first album I ever made and not only did he play the record on air, he sent me back a postcard with a personal remembrance of Chicago, of visiting a matron aunt as a child in Evanston, the suburb where my post office box was kept. I treasured that note as the first indication that John Peel was a great man.
So these independent bands had to be resourceful. They’d built their own infrastructure of independent clubs, promoters, fanzines and DJs. They had their own channels of promotion, including the beginnings of the internet culture that is so prevalent today – that being bulletin boards, and newsgroups. These independent bands even made their own record label. Some were collectives and those that weren’t were likely to operate on a profit-sharing basis that encouraged efficiency, rather than a recoupable patronage system that encouraged indulgence.
That’s where I cut my teeth, in that independent scene full of punks and noise freaks and drag queens and experimental composers and jabbering street poets. You can thank punk rock for all of that. That’s where most of us learned that it was possible to make your own records, to conduct your own business and keep control of your own career. If a bunch of pimply glue sniffers could do it, we reasoned, then anybody could.
The number of records released this way was incredible. Thousands of small releases made their way into the “mom and pop” independent speciality stores, which then provided a market for independent distribution. It was the beginnings of an alternative to the label paradigm. It was cumbersome and slow but it was more efficient than a shotgun approach with the big labels, whose answer to every problem was to spend more of the band’s money on it.
It was the beginning of what we would call the peer network. By mid-90s there were independent labels and distributors moving millions of dollars of records and CDs. And there was a healthy underground economy of bands making a reasonable income owing to the superior efficiencies of the independent methods. My band, as an example, was returned 50% of the net profit on every title that we released through our record label. I worked it out and that earned us a better per-piece royalty than Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Prince, Madonna or any other superstar operating concurrently. And we were only one of thousands of such bands.
So, that was the system as it was. That’s what we lost when the internet made everything available everywhere for free. And make no mistake about it, we have lost it. There is still an independent label network but it’s a slim fraction of what it was. The labels continuing to survive do so by supplying niche music to a discerning audience. And because they have been steeled in the art of efficiency their constitution allows them to scale everything to suit the remaining demand.
You may have noticed that in my description of the mass market music scene and the industry as it was pre-internet I made little mention of the audience or the bands. Those two ends of the spectrum were hardly considered by the rest of the business. Fans were expected to listen to the radio and buy records and bands were expected to make records and tour to promote them. And that was about all the thought either were given. But the audience was where all the money came from and the bands were where all the music came from.
Through the internet, which more than anything else creates access to things, limitless music eventually became available for free. The big record companies didn’t see how to make money from online distribution so they effectively ignored it, leaving it to the hackers and the audience to populate a new landscape of downloading. People who prefer the convenience of CDs over LPs naturally prefer downloaded music even more. You could download it or stream it or listen from YouTube or have your friends on message boards or acquaintances send you zip files. In the blink of an eye music went from being rare, expensive and only available through physical media in controlled outlets to being ubiquitous and free worldwide. What a fantastic development.
There’s a lot of shade thrown by people in the music industry about how terrible the free sharing of music is, how it’s the equivalent of theft, etc. That’s all bullshit and we’ll deal with that in a minute. But for a minute I want you to look at the experience of music from a fan’s perspective, post-internet. Music that is hard to find was now easy to find. Music to suit my specific tastes, as fucked up as they might be, was now accessible by a few clicks or maybe posting a query on a message board. In response I had more access to music than I had ever imagined. Curated by other enthusiasts, keen to turn me on to the good stuff; people, like me, who want other people to hear the best music ever.
This audience-driven music distribution has other benefits. Long-forgotten music has been given a second life. And bands whose music that was ahead of its time has been allowed to reach a niche audience that the old mass distribution failed to find for them, as one enthusiast turns on the next and this forgotten music finally gets it due. There’s a terrific documentary about one such case, the Detroit band Death whose sole album was released in a perfunctory edition in, I believe, 1975 and disappeared until a copy of it was digitised and made public on the internet. Gradually the band found an audience, their music got lovingly reissued, and the band has resurrected, complete with tours playing to packed houses. And the band are now being allowed the career that the old star system had denied them. There are hundreds of such stories and there are speciality labels that do nothing but reissue lost classics like that once they surface.
Now look at the conditions from a band’s perspective, the conditions faced by a band. In contrast to back in the day, recording equipment and technology has simplified and become readily available. Computers now come pre-loaded with enough software to make a decent demo recording and guitar stores sell microphones and other equipment inexpensively that previously was only available at a premium from arcane speciality sources. Essentially every band now has the opportunity to make recordings.
And they can do things with those recordings. They can post them online in any number of places: Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud, their own websites. They can link to them on message boards, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and even in the comment streams of other music. “LOL,” “this sucks,” “much better,” “death to false metal,” “LOL”. Instead of spending a fortune on international phone calls trying to find someone in each territory to listen to your music, every band on the planet now has free, instant access to the world at its fingertips.
I cannot overstate how important a development that is. Previously, in the top-down paradigm allowed local industry to dictate what music was available in isolated or remote markets, markets isolated by location or language. It was inconceivable that a smaller or independent band could have market penetration into, say, Greece or Turkey, Japan or China, South America, Africa or the Balkans. Who would you ask to handle your music? How would you find him? And how would you justify the business and currency complications required to send four or five copies of a record there?
Now those places are as well-served as New York and London. Fans can find the music they like and develop direct relationships with the bands. It is absolutely possible – I’m sure it happens every day – that a kid in one of these far-flung places can find a new favourite band, send that band a message, and that singer of that band will read it and personally reply to it from his cell phone half a world away. How much better is that? I’ll tell you, it’s infinitely better than having a relationship to a band limited to reading it on the back of the record jacket. If such a thing were possible when I was a teenager I’m certain I would have become a right nuisance to the Ramones.
A couple of years ago my band mounted a tour of eastern Europe. We played all the hot spots: the Czech Republic, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, we made it as far as Istanbul, Turkey. It was a magical experience, playing in front of audiences who were relatively unjaded by the routine of touring bands and we were welcomed like friends. We played to full houses at the same size venues as the rest of Europe. The same sizes as we would play here in Australia. And the audiences seem equivocally familiar with our music. The key difference being that most of the places have literally never sold a single record. Essentially 100% of our exposure had been through informal means over the internet or hand-to-hand.
On that trip we established contacts with local promoters and arts organisations and audiences developed an appetite for our music and we have since sold quite a few records into the region. Our next tour through the region was easier as a result and we’re going back to Istanbul this spring, using contacts made on that first exploratory trip. I expect to have a marvellous time.
In short, the internet has made it much easier to conduct the day-to-day business of being in a band and has increased the efficiency. Everything from scheduling rehearsals using online calendars, to booking tours by email, to selling merchandise and records from online stores, down to raising the funds to make a record is a new simplicity that bands of the pre-internet era would salivate over. The old system was built by the industry to serve the players inside the industry. The new system where music is shared informally and the bands have a direct relationship to the fans was built by the bands and the fans in the manner of the old underground. It skips all the intermediary steps.
Bands now have default control of their exposure. It’s no longer necessary to pay people to pay other people to play your records on the radio, only to have those people lie about doing so. It’s no longer necessary to spend money to let people hear your band. It happens automatically.
There’s another, much subtler change that all this instigated. Since people no longer have to make do listening to whatever is on the radio playlist and are no longer limited to owning what the store decides to stock, they have become much more indulgent in their tastes. My friends now normally listen to exotic playlists that they have dreamed up themselves, full of counterintuitive and contrasting choices that are uniquely theirs.
Our office bearer has a hi-fi in that studio office and is as likely to be playing the new 45 from the hardcore band Leather or electro drone by Tim Hecker as he is to be playing a deep cut of Cincinnati soul or handbag disco or improv guitar noodlings, whether newly released from Oren Ambarchi or 30 years old from the Takoma label. People can now listen only to music they are ecstatic about, all the time.
There are active online communities for every kind of music and its subcultures. Whether you’re into Dusty’s Deep Cut reggae, minimal electronics, symphonic pop, Texas blues, Japanese noise, power electronics, children’s music, christmas music, Raymond Scott, or Burl Ives, I guarantee there is an online community where you can connect with other enthusiasts to indulge the minute specificity of your tastes.
These online communities are now a vital part of the scene and this debate and others are hashed out there daily. I’ve probably unconsciously lifted some of my positions in these remarks from discussions I’ve had online so I’d like to confess that plagiarism now, as a way to encourage all of you to get involved in these forums where all the interesting conversations about music is happening.
Imagine a great hall of fetishes where whatever you felt like fucking or being fucked by, however often your tastes might change, no matter what hardware or harnesses were required, you could open the gates and have at it on a comfy mattress at any time of day. That’s what the internet has become for music fans. Plus bleacher seats for a cheering section.
As a result fans are more ardent for this music. They are willing to spend more on seeing it played live. They are willing to buy more ephemera and eager to establish a personal relationship to the people who make the music. Gig prices have escalated as a result. And the merchandise tables at gigs are universally teeming with activity. Back home, gigs that used to cost five or six bucks are now 20 or 30. Over here the ticket inflation has been more pronounced, with club gigs going for $80 or more. As a result gig income for bands has increased exponentially. My band has been playing a lot of the same places for the entirety of our existence, over 20 years now. I guess you could say we’ve saturated our audience, no matter how long we stay at it. Some of these perennial gigs are now paying an over of magnitude better than they were 10 or 15 years ago. That’s right, some places where we used to earn four or five hundred dollars we now earn four or five grand.
This ease of access, redoubled interest and increase in income has created a new partnership and possibilities between individuals, bands and visual artists, online film-makers, choreographers and other kinds of public people. Collaborations take place in real time or displaced over the internet where the parties often never meet face-to-face. I have a dear friend who found himself with a bunch of time on his hands last year so he formed a couple of new bands. One of these bands was entirely populated by people he only knew online and all of their music was made by online collaboration. This music was a pure result of the interconnectivity of the internet.
All of that, all of those characteristics, all of those possibilities were instigated and made possible by the online sharing of music. If not directly, as in the case of building an audience for the band Death and my own band in the Balkans and beyond, then indirectly by changing the expectations of the listeners and musicians.
This explains my enthusiasm for the way the music scene has changed, but what about my optimism? I would like to address a platitude about the online exposure of music. From all quarters we hear that, this is the platitude: “We need to figure out how to make internet distribution work for everyone.” I use finger quotes to indicate intellectual distance between myself and the quotation. I have a friend, Tim Midgett, who uses three fingers for finger quotes to indicate extra irony. This is a two jobber.
I disagree with this rather inoffensive platitude. It’s innocuous and vapid and fills the air after someone asks the question, “How is the music scene these days?” And it maintains hope that the current state of affairs as mentioned, presumed to be tragic, can be changed for the better. For “everyone”. That word everyone is important to the people using the sentence. In their mind the physical distribution model worked for everyone. But the new one does not. Not yet, not yet. Not until we “figure it out”. I’m sure we’re all going to get tired of me doing that .
I disagree that the old way is better. And I do not believe this sentence to be true: “We need to figure out how to make this digital distribution work for everyone.” I disagree with it because within its mundane language are tacit assumptions: the framework of an exploitative system that I have been at odds with my whole creative life. Inside that trite sentence, “We need to figure out how to make this work for everyone,” hides the skeleton of a monster.
Let’s start at the beginning. “We need to figure out”: the subject of that sentence, the first-person plural, sounds inclusive but the context defeats that presumption. Who would have the power to implement a new distribution paradigm? Who would be in the room when we discuss our plans for it? Who would do the out figuring we need to do? Industry and consumers? Consumers is a likely response, but did the consumers get a vote about how their music would be compressed or tagged or copy protected or made volatile? Did anybody? Did the consumers get a choice about whether or not Apple stuck a U2 album on their iTunes library? Of course not. These things were just done and we had to deal with them as a state of being. Consumers rebelling or complaining about things – “market pushback” – isn’t the same thing as being involved in the decision to do something. Clearly the “we” of this sentence doesn’t include the listener. I believe any attempt to organise the music scene that ignores the listener is doomed.
How about the bands? Do the bands get a seat at the “we” table, while our figuring-out needs are met? Of course not. If you ask bands what they want – and I know this because I’m in a band and I deal with bands every day – what they want is a chance to expose their music and to have a shot at getting paid by their audience. I believe the current operating status satisfies the first of these conditions exquisitely and the latter at least as well as the old record label paradigm.
So who is this “we”? The administrative parts of the old record business, that’s who. The vertical labels who hold copyright on a lot of music. They want to do the figuring. They want to set the agenda. And they want to do all the structural tinkering. The bands, the audience, the people who make music and who pay for it – they are conspicuously not in the discussion.
How about the word “need”, we “need” to figure out? The need is actually a “want”, a preference. These remnants of the music industry are unsatisfied with how the internet, the bands and the audience can get along fine without them. So they prefer to change things to re-establish relevance. You see this in the spate of 360 deals that are being offered now, where everything a band does, from their music to their T-shirts to their Twitter accounts belong to the record label. In exchange the record label offers startup money. I believe this approach is doomed by things like Kickstarter, which have proven more effective and efficient at raising money directly from the audience that wants to support the music.
How about the infinitive “to figure out”? We need “to figure out”. That presumes that we can know how to attack a global distribution enterprise long after the internet has crowdsourced an efficient and painless way to do precisely that. There’s a reason the water faucet hasn’t changed radically over the years. Time and trial have demonstrated that the best and simplest way to control hot water is by turning a tap. Problem solved, no further solving of the hot water faucet problem is required. I cannot be the only one who is annoyed by the constantly misaligned proximity faucets in public washrooms. Imagine if listening to music was as frustrating as that.
The next part of the sentence: “make” distribution work. This implies that we have control over the distribution, that we can make it do some things but not others. The internet proves this to be a fallacy. Once we release music it’s out of our control. I use the verb “release” because it’s common vernacular. But I think it’s a perfect description. Even more apt if you consider what happens when you release other things, say a bird or a fart. When you release them they’re in the world and the world will react and use them as it sees fit. The fart may wrinkle noses until it dissipates. The bird may fly outside and crap on windshields; it may get shot down by a farmer. It’s been released, so you have no control over it. You can’t recall the fart, however much you would like to. You can’t protect the bird.
Distribution is a problematic word. Its prior meaning implies scarcity and allocation of physical products. You can inventory them, you could tax them, duty them, you could search somebody’s book bag for them. None of that is true with digital files. If it were possible to return digital files to the strict control of the record labels (it is impossible, don’t worry), what would be their incentive to be honest in their accounting? In the physical distribution model you could inventory the titles in the warehouse during an audit and compare them with the delivery manifests from the press manufacturing plant, and know with reasonable accuracy how many copies had been sold. How on earth would you inventory a digital file? Count how many were left on the shelf?
That word is problematic, but the most problematic word in the sentence is the word “work”: we need to figure out how to make it “work”. Work is an impossible word in this context. Depending on who uses it, it will have contradictory meanings. For a label the system would work if it generated a profit per play, controlled access to music while providing access to the audience for advertisers as an additional income, and allowed the availability of push marketing for promotion. For the listener it would mean open access, ability to find specific and niche music, continuous playback, lack of nuisance, ease of use, freedom from spying, low or no cost, utility on different devices, lack of push marketing and lack of advertising. For a band it would mean finding an audience and having no barrier to participation, and no limits on amount of material made available. You can see how this is problematic. It is literally impossible for a system to satisfy all of these needs simultaneously when they are contradictory.
And the hybrid approaches being tried are clumsy and insulting. I recently tried streaming a podcast from an official licensed site. When the cats started fighting I missed a little bit, having to separate the cats and then feed the cats and then calmed them down. I came back to my computer and tried to replay the last few minutes that I had missed but was greeted with a notice that due to copyright agreements this player was not allowed to rewind the podcast. I find it unimaginable that the people who posted the podcast wanted that provision enabled. And the site just ensured that I would never bother with their product again.
The conclusion of that sentence, the “for everyone” is also problematic. I don’t think it is necessary or even preferable to have everyone involved in defining the experience with music or more generally the relationship with the band and its audience. We seem to accept that record stores, who were once the welcoming face of the industry and the recipient of much promotional patronage described earlier, are not coming along in the digital era. Record stores now get their appeal from carrying secondhand records, something the industry used to have a regular shit fit about. And by carrying speciality and niche material that is too marginal for corporate attention, they are clearly not part of the “everyone” in the sentence.
So there’s no reason to insist that other obsolete bureaux and offices of the lapsed era be brought along into the new one. The music industry has shrunk. In shrinking it has rung out the middle, leaving the bands and the audiences to work out their relationship from the ends. I see this as both healthy and exciting. If we’ve learned anything over the past 30 years it’s that left to its own devices bands and their audiences can get along fine: the bands can figure out how to get their music out in front of an audience and the audience will figure out how to reward them.
The internet has facilitated the most direct and efficient, compact relationship ever between band and audience. And I do not mourn the loss of the offices of inefficiencies that died in the process. I suppose some people are out of work. But the same things happened when the automobile replaced the horse, and all the blacksmiths had to adapt, spending their time making garden gates rather than horseshoes.
When I read over these notes on the plane today I felt like I spent too much time enumerating complaints, and I don’t want to conclude without reiterating how terrific the current music environment is. I see more bands and I hear more music than ever before in my life. There are more gigs, more songs available than ever before, bands are being treated with more respect, and are more in control of their careers and destinies. I see them continuing as a constellation of enterprises: some big, some small – most small but all of them with a more immediate response from their audience and a greater chance to succeed. It is genuinely exciting.
I’ve been talking an awful long time, but I have not yet mentioned the intellectual property debate. I’ll try to get that out of the way briefly now. I would like to leave room for questions after I speak, and though I’m leaving out a lot – publishing, stolen credits, sampling, fair use, inspiration – I suspect there will be a healthy discussion afterward and think that such discussions are necessary and overdue.
From my part, I believe the very concept of exclusive intellectual property with respect to recorded music has come to a natural end, or something like an end. Technology has brought to a head a need to embrace the meaning of the word “release”, as in bird or fart. It is no longer possible to maintain control over digitised material and I don’t believe the public good is served by trying to.
There is great public good by letting creative material lapse into the public ownership. The copyright law has been modified so extensively in the past decades that now this essentially never happens, creating absurdities whenever copyright is invoked. There’s a huge body of work that is not legally in the public domain, though its rights holder, authors and creators have died or disappeared as businesses. And this material, from a legal standpoint now removed from our culture – nobody may copy it or re-release it because it’s still subject to copyright.
Other absurdities abound: innocuous usage of music in the background of home videos or student projects is technically an infringement and official obstacles are set up to prevent it. If you want a video of your wedding reception – your father’s first dance with a new bride – it’s off limits unless it is silent. If your little daughter does a kooky dance to a Prince song don’t bother putting it on YouTube for her grandparents to see or a purple dwarf in assless chaps will put an injunction on you. Did I offend the little guy? Fuck him. His music is poison and he hits women.
Music has entered the environment as an atmospheric element, like the wind, and in that capacity should not be subject to control and compensation. Well, not unless the rights holders are willing to let me turn the tables on it. If you think my listening is worth something, OK then, so do I. Play a Phil Collins song while I’m grocery shopping? Pay me $20. Def Leppard? Make it $100. Miley Cyrus? They don’t print money big enough."

Smooth,santana ,1999,1990,"Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

Or else forget about it

Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying,gerry ,1964,1960,"Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
The night's the time for all your tears

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
The night-time shadows disappear
And with them go all your tears
For the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy
So don't let the sun catch you cryin'
We know that cryin's not a bad thing
But stop your cryin' when the birds sing
It may be hard to discover
That you've been left for another

Guilt, Bad Conscience, and Related Matters
1
To breed an animal that is entitled to make promises—is that not precisely the paradoxical task nature has set itself where human beings are concerned? Isn’t that the real problem of human beings? . . . The fact that this problem has to a great extent been solved must seem all the more astonishing to a person who knows how to appreciate fully the power which works against this promise-making, namely forgetfulness. Forgetfulness is not merely a vis interiae , as superficial people think. Is it much rather an active capability to repress, something positive in the strongest sense, to which we can ascribe the fact that while we are digesting what we alone live through and experience and absorb into ourselves (we could call the process mental ingestion ), we are conscious of what is going  on as little as we are with the entire thousand-fold process which our bodily nourishment goes through (so-called physical ingestion ). The doors and windows of consciousness are shut temporarily; they remain undisturbed by the noise and struggle with which the underworld of our functional organs keeps working for and against one another; a little stillness, a little tabula rasa  of the consciousness, so that there will again be room for something new, above all, for the nobler functions and officials, for ruling, thinking ahead, determining what to do (for our organism is arranged as an oligarchy)—that is, as I said, the use of active forgetfulness, a porter at the door, so to speak, a custodian of psychic order, quiet, etiquette.  From that we can see at once how, if forgetfulness were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic (and not just compare)—he is “finished” with nothing. . . . Now, this particular animal, which is necessarily forgetful, in which forgetfulness is present as a force, as a form of strong health, has had an opposing capability bred into it, a memory, with the help of which, in certain cases, forgetfulness will cease to function—that is, for those cases where promises are to be made. This is in no way a merely passive inability ever to be rid of an impression once it has been etched into the mind, nor is it merely indigestion over a word one has pledged at a particular time  and which one can no longer be over and done with. No, it’s an active wish not to be free of the matter again, an ongoing and continuing desire for what one willed at a particular time, a real memory of one’s will, so that between the original “I will,” “I will do,” and the actual discharge of the will, its action, a world of strange new things, circumstances, even acts of the will can be interposed without a second thought and not break this long chain of the will. But how much all that presupposes! In order to organize the future in this manner, human beings must have first learned to separate necessary events from chance events, to think in terms of cause and effect, to see distant events as if they were present, to anticipate them, to set goals and the means to reach them with certainty, to develop a capability for figures and calculations in general—and for that to occur, a human being must necessarily have first himself become something one could predict, something bound by regular rules, even in the way he imagined himself to himself, so that finally he is able to act like someone who makes promises—he can make himself into a pledge for the future!
2
Precisely that development is the long history of the origin of responsibility. That task of breeding an animal which is permitted to make promises contains within it, as we have already grasped, as a condition and prerequisite, the more precise task of first making a human being necessarily uniform to some extent, one among others like him, regular and consequently predictable. The immense task involved in this, what I have called the “morality of custom” (cf. Daybreak 9, 14, 16)—the essential work of a man on his own self in the longest-lasting age of the human race, his entire prehistorical work, derives its meaning, its grand justification, from the following point, no matter how much hardship, tyranny, monotony, and idiocy it also manifested: with the help of the morality of custom and the social strait jacket, the human being was made truly predictable. Let’s position ourselves, by contrast, at the end of this immense process, in the place where the tree at last yields its fruit, where society and the morality of custom finally bring to light the end for which they were simply the means: then we find, as the ripest fruit on that tree, the sovereign individual, something which resembles only itself, which has broken loose again from the morality of custom, the autonomous individual beyond morality (for “autonomous” and “moral” are mutually exclusive terms), in short, the human being who possesses his own independent and enduring will, who is entitled to make promises—and in him a consciousness quivering in every muscle, proud of what has finally been achieved and has become a living embodiment in him, a real consciousness of power and freedom, a feeling of completion for human beings generally. This man who has become free, who really is entitled to make promises, this master of free will, this sovereign—how is he not to realize the superiority he enjoys over everything which is not permitted to make a promise and make pledges on its own behalf, knowing how much trust, how much fear, and how much respect he creates—he “is worthy” of all three—and how, with this mastery over himself, he has necessarily been given in addition mastery over his circumstances, over nature, and over all less reliable creatures with a shorter will? The “free” man, the owner of an enduring unbreakable will, by possessing this, also acquires his own standard of value: he looks out from himself at others and confers respect or contempt. And just as it will be necessary for him to honour those like him, the strong and dependable (who are entitled to make promises)—in other words, everyone who makes promises like a sovereign, seriously, rarely, and slowly, who is sparing with his trust, who honours another when he does trust, who gives his word as something reliable, because he knows he is strong enough to remain upright even when opposed by misfortune, even when “opposed by fate”—in just the same way it will be necessary for him to keep his foot ready to kick the scrawny unreliable men, who make promises without being entitled to, and to hold his cane ready for the liar, who breaks his word in the very moment it comes out of his mouth. The proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of responsibility, the consciousness of this rare freedom, of this power over oneself and destiny, has become internalized into the deepest parts of him and grown instinctual, has become an instinct, a dominating instinct:—what will he call it, this dominating instinct, assuming that he finds he needs a word for it? There’s no doubt: the sovereign man calls this instinct his conscience.
3
His conscience? . . . To begin with, we can conjecture that the idea “conscience,” which we are encountering here in its highest, almost perplexing form, has a long history and changing developmental process behind it already. To be entitled to pledge one’s word, and to do it with pride, and also to be permitted to say “Yes” to oneself—that is a ripe fruit, as I have mentioned, but it is also a late fruit:—for what a long stretch of time this fruit must have hung tart and sour on the tree! And for an even much longer time it was impossible to see any such fruit—no one could have promised it would appear, even if everything about the tree was certainly getting ready for it and growing in that very direction!—“How does one create a memory for the human animal? How does one stamp something like that into this partly dull, partly flickering, momentary understanding, this living embodiment of forgetfulness, so that it stays current?” . . .  This ancient problem, as you can imagine, was not resolved right away with tender answers and methods. Indeed, there is perhaps nothing more fearful and more terrible in the entire prehistory of human beings than the technique for developing his memory. “We burn something in so that it remains in the memory. Only something which never ceases to cause pain remains in the memory”—that is a leading principle of the most ancient (unfortunately also the longest) psychology on earth. We might even say that everywhere on earth nowadays where there is still solemnity, seriousness, mystery, and gloomy colours in the lives of men and people, something of that terror continues its work, the fear with which in earlier times everywhere on earth people made promises, pledged their word, made a vow. The past, the longest, deepest, most severe past, breathes on us and surfaces in us when we become “solemn.” When the human being considered it necessary to make a memory for himself, it never happened without blood, martyrs, and sacrifices, the most terrible sacrifices and pledges (among them the sacrifice of the first born), the most repulsive self-mutilations (for example, castration), the cruellest forms of ritual in all the religious cults (and all religions are in their deepest foundations systems of cruelty)—all that originates in that instinct which discovered in pain the most powerful means of helping to develop the memory. In a certain sense all asceticism belongs here: a couple of ideas are to be made indissoluble, omnipresent, unforgettable, “fixed,” in order to hypnotize the entire nervous and intellectual system through these “fixed ideas”—and the ascetic procedures and forms of life are the means whereby these ideas are freed from jostling around with all the other ideas, in order to make them “unforgettable.” The worse humanity’s “memory” was, the more terrible its customs have always appeared. The harshness of the laws of punishment, in particular, provide a standard for measuring how much trouble people went to in order to triumph over forgetfulness and to maintain a present awareness of a few primitive demands of social living together for this slave of momentary feelings and desires. We Germans certainly do not think of ourselves as an especially cruel and hard-hearted people, even less as particularly careless people who live only in the present. But just take a look at our old penal code in order to understand how much trouble it takes on this earth to breed a “People of Thinkers” (by that I mean the European people among whom today we still find a maximum of trust, seriousness, tastelessness, and practicality, and who, with these characteristics, have a right to breed all sorts of European mandarins). These Germans have used terrible means to make themselves a memory in order to attain mastery over their vulgar basic instincts and their brutal crudity: think of the old German punishments, for example, stoning (—the legend even lets the mill stone fall on the head of the guilty person), breaking on the wheel (the most characteristic invention and specialty of the German genius in the realm of punishment!), impaling on a stake, ripping people apart or stamping them to death with horses (“quartering”), boiling the criminal in oil or wine (still done in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries), the well-loved practice of flaying (“cutting flesh off in strips”), carving flesh out of the chest, and probably covering the offender with honey and leaving him to the flies in the burning sun. With the help of such images and procedures people finally retained five or six “I will not’s” in the memory, and, so far as these precepts were concerned, they gave their word in order to live with the advantages of society—and it’s true! With the assistance of this sort of memory people finally came to “reason”!—Ah, reason, seriousness, mastery over emotions, this whole gloomy business called reflection, all these privileges and showpieces of human beings: how expensive they were! How much blood and horror is at the bottom of all “good things”! . . .
4
But then how did that other “gloomy business,” the consciousness of guilt, the whole “bad conscience” come into the world?—And with this we turn back to our genealogists of morality. I’ll say it once more—or have I not said anything about it yet?—they are useless. With their own merely “modern” experience extending through only a brief period , with no knowledge of and no desire to know the past, even less a historical instinct, a “second sight”— something necessary at this very point—they nonetheless pursue the history of morality. That must justifiably produce results which have a less than tenuous relationship to the truth. Have these genealogists of morality up to now allowed themselves to dream, even remotely, that, for instance, that major moral principle “guilt”  derived its origin from the very materialistic idea “debt” ? Or that punishment developed as a repayment, completely without reference to any assumption about freedom or lack of freedom of the will?—and did so, by contrast, to the point where it always first required a high degree of human development so that the animal “man” began to make those much more primitive distinctions between “intentional,” “negligent,” “accidental,” “responsible,” and their opposites and bring them to bear when meting out punishment? That idea, nowadays so trite, apparently so natural, so unavoidable, which has even had to serve as the explanation how the feeling of justice in general came into existence on earth, “The criminal deserves punishment because he could have acted otherwise,” this idea is, in fact, an extremely late achievement, indeed, a sophisticated form of human judgment and decision making. Anyone who moves this idea back to the beginnings is sticking his coarse fingers inappropriately into the psychology of older humanity. For the most extensive period of human history, punishment was certainly not meted out because people held the instigator of evil responsible for his actions, and thus it was not assumed that only the guilty party should be punished:—it was much more as it still is now when parents punish their children out of anger over some harm they have suffered, anger vented on the perpetrator—but anger restrained and modified through the idea that every injury has some equivalent and that compensation for it could, in fact, be paid out, even if that is through the pain of the perpetrator. Where did this primitive, deeply rooted, and perhaps by now ineradicable idea derive its power, the idea of an equivalence between punishment and pain? I have already given away the answer: in the contractual relationship between creditor and debtor, which is, in general, as ancient as the idea of “legal subject” and which, for its part, refers back to the basic forms of buying, selling, bartering, trading, and exchanging goods.
5
It’s true that recalling this contractual relationship arouses, as we might initially expect from what I have observed above, all sorts of suspicion of and opposition to older humanity, which established or allowed it. It’s at this particular moment that people make promises. At this very point the pertinent issue is to create a memory for the person who makes a promise, so that precisely here, we can surmise, there will exist a place for harshness, cruelty, and pain. In order to inspire trust in his promise to pay back, in order to give his promise a guarantee of its seriousness and sanctity, in order to impress on his own conscience the idea of paying back as a duty, an obligation, the debtor, by virtue of a contract, pledges to the creditor, in the event that he does not pay, something else that he still “owns,” something else over which he still exercises power, for example, his body or his woman or his freedom or even his life (or, under certain religious conditions, even his blessedness, the salvation of his soul, finally even his peace in the grave, as was the case in Egypt, where the dead body of the debtor even in the tomb found no peace from the creditor—and among the Egyptians, in particular, such peace certainly mattered). That means that the creditor could inflict all kinds of ignominy and torture on the body of the debtor, for instance, slice off the body as much as seemed appropriate for the size of the debt:—and this point of view early on and everywhere gave rise to precise, sometimes horrific estimates going into the smallest detail, legally established estimates about individual limbs and body parts. I consider it already a step forward, as evidence of a freer conception of the law, something which calculates more grandly, a more Roman idea of justice, when Rome’s Twelve Tables of Laws decreed it was all the same, no matter how much or how little the creditor cut off in such cases: “let it not be thought a crime if they cut off more or less.”* Let us clarify for ourselves the logic of this whole method of compensation—it is weird enough. The equivalency is given in this way: instead of an advantage making up directly for the harm (hence, instead of compensation in gold, land, possessions of some sort or another), the creditor is given a kind of pleasure as repayment and compensation—the pleasure of being allowed to discharge his power on a powerless person without having to think about it, the delight in “de fair le mal pour le plaisir de le faire” , the enjoyment of violation. This enjoyment is more highly prized the lower and baser the creditor stands in the social order, and it can easily seem to him a delicious mouthful, in fact, a foretaste of a higher rank. By means of the “punishment” of the debtor, the creditor participates in a right belonging to the masters. Finally he also for once comes to the lofty feeling of despising a being as someone “beneath him,” as someone he is entitled to mistreat—or at least, in the event that the real force of punishment, of executing punishment, has already been transferred to the “authorities,” the feeling of seeing the debtor despised and mistreated. The compensation thus consists of an order for and a right to cruelty.
6
In this area, that is, in the laws of obligation, the world of the moral concepts “guilt,” “conscience,” “duty,” and “sanctity of obligation” has its origin—its beginning, like the beginning of everything great on earth, was watered thoroughly and for a long time with blood. And can we not add that this world deep down has never again been completely free of a certain smell of blood and torture—(not even with old Kant whose categorical imperative stinks of cruelty)? In addition, here that weird knot linking the ideas of “guilt and suffering,” which perhaps has become impossible to undo, was first knit together. Let me pose the question once more: to what extent can suffering be a compensation for “debts”? To the extent that making someone suffer provides the highest degree of pleasure, to the extent that the person hurt by the debt, in exchange for the injury as well as for the distress caused by the injury, got an extraordinary offsetting pleasure: creating suffering—a real celebration, something that, as I’ve said, was valued all the more, the greater it contradicted the rank and social position of the creditor. I have been speculating here, for it’s difficult to see through to the foundations of such subterranean things, quite apart from the fact that it’s embarrassing. And anyone who crudely throws into the middle of all this the idea of “revenge” has buried and dimmed his insights rather than illuminated them (—revenge itself, in fact, simply takes us back to the same problem: “How can making someone suffer give us a feeling of satisfaction?”). It seems to me that the delicacy and, even more, the Tartufferie  of tame house pets (I mean modern man, I mean us) resist imagining with all our power how much cruelty contributes to the great celebratory joy of older humanity, as, in fact, an ingredient mixed into almost all their enjoyments and, from another perspective, how naive, how innocent, their need for cruelty appears, how they fundamentally think of its particular “disinterested malice” (or to use Spinoza’s words, the sympathia malevolens ) as a normal human characteristic:—and hence as something to which their conscience says a heartfelt Yes!* A more deeply penetrating eye might still notice, even today, enough of this most ancient and most fundamental celebratory human joy. In Beyond Good and Evil, 229 (even earlier in Daybreak, 18, 77, 113), I pointed a cautious finger at the constantly growing spiritualization and “deification” of cruelty, which runs through the entire history of higher culture (and, in a significant sense, even constitutes that culture). In any case, it’s not so long ago that people wouldn’t think of an aristocratic wedding and folk festival in the grandest style without executions, tortures, or something like an auto-da-fé , and similarly no noble household lacked creatures on whom people could vent their malice and cruel taunts without a second thought (—remember, for instance, Don Quixote at the court of the duchess; today we read all of Don Quixote with a bitter taste on the tongue; it’s almost an ordeal. In so doing, we would become very foreign, very obscure to the author and his contemporaries—they read it with a fully clear conscience as the most cheerful of books. They almost died laughing at it). Watching suffering makes people feel good; creating suffering makes them feel even better—that’s a harsh principle, but an old, powerful, and human, all-too-human major principle, which, by the way, even the apes might perhaps agree with as well. For people say that, in thinking up bizarre cruelties, the apes already anticipate a great many human actions and are, as it were, an “audition.” Without cruelty there is no celebration: that’s what the oldest and longest human history teaches us—and with punishment, too, there is so much celebration!
7
With these ideas, by the way, I have no desire whatsoever to give our pessimists grist for their discordant mills grating with weariness of life. On the contrary, I want to state very clearly that in that period when human beings had not yet become ashamed of their cruelty, life on earth was happier than it is today, now that we have our pessimists. The darkening of heaven over men’s heads has always increased alarmingly in proportion to the growth of human beings’ shame before human beings. The tired, pessimistic look, the mistrust of the riddle of life, the icy denial stemming from disgust with life—these are not the signs of the wickedest eras of human beings. It’s much more the case that they first come to light as the swamp plants they are when the swamp to which they belong is there—I mean the sickly mollycoddling and moralizing, thanks to which the animal “man” finally learns to feel shame about all his instincts. On his way to becoming an “angel” (not to use a harsher word here), man cultivated for himself that upset stomach and that furry tongue which not only made the joy and innocence of the animal repulsive but also made life itself distasteful:—so that now and then he stands there before himself, holds his nose, and with Pope Innocent III disapproves and makes a catalogue of his nastiness (“conceived in filth, disgustingly nourished in his mother’s body, developed out of evil material stuff, stinking horribly, a secretion of spit, urine, and excrement”).* Now, when suffering always has to march out as the first among the arguments against existence, as its most serious question mark, it’s good for us to remember the times when people judged things the other way around, because they couldn’t do without making people suffer and saw a first-class magic  in it, a really tempting enticement for living.  Perhaps, and let me say this as a consolation for the delicate, at that time pain did not yet hurt as much as it does nowadays. That at least could be the conclusion of a doctor who had treated a Negro (taking the latter as a representative of prehistorical man) for a bad case of inner inflammation, which drives the European, even one with the best constitution, almost to despair, but which does not have the same effect on the Negro. (The graph of the human sensitivity to pain seems in fact to sink down remarkably and almost immediately after one has moved beyond the first ten thousand or ten million of the top members of the higher culture. And I personally have no doubt that, in comparison with one painful night of a single hysterical well-educated female, the total suffering of all animals which up to now have been interrogated by the knife in search of scientific answers is simply not worth considering). Perhaps it is even permissible to concede the possibility that that pleasure in cruelty does not really need to have died out. It would only require a certain sublimation and subtlety, in proportion to the way pain hurts more nowadays; in other words, it would have to appear translated into the imaginative and spiritual and embellished with nothing but names so unobjectionable that they arouse no suspicion in even the most delicate hypocritical conscience (“tragic pity” is one  such name; another is “les nostalgies de la croix” ). What truly enrages people about suffering is not the suffering itself, but the meaninglessness of suffering. But neither for the Christian, who has interpreted into suffering an entire secret machinery for salvation, nor for the naive men of older times, who understood how to interpret all suffering in relation to the spectator or to the person inflicting the suffering, was there generally any such meaningless suffering. In order for the hidden, undiscovered, unwitnessed suffering to be removed from the world and for people to be able to deny it honestly, they were then almost compelled to invent gods and intermediate beings at all levels, high and low—briefly put, something that also roamed in hidden places, that also looked into the darkness, and that would not readily permit an interesting painful spectacle to escape its attention. For with the help of such inventions life then understood and has always understood how to justify itself by a trick, how to justify its “evil.” Nowadays perhaps it requires other helpful inventions for that purpose (for example, life as riddle, life as a problem of knowledge). “Every evil a glimpse of which edifies a god is justified”: that’s how the prehistorical logic of feeling rang out—and was that really confined only to prehistory? The gods conceived of as friends of cruel spectacle—O how widely this primitive idea still rises up even within our European humanity! We might well seek advice from, say, Calvin and Luther on this point. At any rate it is certain that even the Greeks knew of no more acceptable snack to offer their gods to make them happy than the joys of cruelty. With what sort of expression, do you think, did Homer allow his gods to look down on the fates of men? What final sense was there basically in the Trojan War and similar tragic terrors? We cannot entertain the slightest doubts about this: they were intended as celebrations for the gods: and, to the extent that the poet is in these matters more “godlike” than other men, as festivals for the poets as well. . . . Later the Greek moral philosophers in the same way imagined the eyes of god no differently, still looking down on the moral struggles, on heroism and the self-mutilation of the virtuous: the “Hercules of duty” was on a stage, and he knew he was there. Without someone watching, virtue for this race of actors was something entirely inconceivable. Surely such a daring and fateful philosophical invention, first made for Europe at that time, the invention of the “free will,” of the absolutely spontaneous nature of human beings in matters of good and evil, was created above all to justify the idea that the interest of gods in men, in human virtue, could never run out? On this earthly stage there was never to be any lack of really new things, really unheard of suspense, complications, catastrophes. A world conceived of as perfectly deterministic would have been predictable to the gods and therefore also soon boring for them—reason enough for these friends of the gods, the philosophers, not to ascribe such a deterministic world to their gods! All of ancient humanity is full of sensitive consideration for “the spectator,” for a truly public, truly visible world, which did not know how to imagine happiness without dramatic performances and festivals. And, as I have already said, in great punishment there is also so much celebration!

To resume the path of our enquiry, the feeling of guilt, of personal obligation has, as we saw, its origin in the oldest and most primitive personal relationship there is, in the relationship between seller and buyer, creditor and debtor. Here for the first time one person moved up against another person, here an individual measured himself against another individual. We have found no civilization still at such a low level that something of this relationship is not already perceptible. To set prices, to measure values, to think up equivalencies, to exchange things—that preoccupied man’s very first thinking to such a degree that in a certain sense it’s what thinking itself is. Here the oldest form of astuteness was bred; here, too, we can assume are the first beginnings of man’s pride, his feeling of pre-eminence in relation to other animals. Perhaps our word “man” (manas) continues to express directly something of this feeling of the self: the human being describes himself as a being which assesses values, which values and measures, as the “inherently calculating animal.” Selling and buying, together with their psychological attributes, are even older than the beginnings of any form of social organizations and groupings; out of the most rudimentary form of personal legal rights the budding feeling of exchange, contract, guilt, law, duty, and compensation was instead first transferred to the crudest and earliest social structures (in their relationships with similar social structures), along with the habit of comparing power with power, of measuring, of calculating. The eye was now adjusted to this perspective, and with that awkward consistency characteristic of thinking in more ancient human beings, hard to get started but then inexorably moving forward in the same direction, people soon reached the great generalization: “Each thing has its price, everything can be paid off”—the oldest and most naive moral principle of justice, the beginning of all “good nature,” all “fairness,” all “good will,” all “objectivity” on earth. Justice at this first stage is good will among those approximately equal in power to come to terms with each other, to “come to an agreement” again with each other by compensation—and in relation to those less powerful, to compel them to arrive at some settlement among themselves.—

Always measured by the standard of prehistory (a prehistory which, by the way, is present at all times or is capable of returning), the community also stands in relation to its members in that important basic relationship of the creditor to his debtor. People live in a community. They enjoy the advantages of a community (and what advantages they are! Nowadays we sometimes underestimate them); they live protected, cared for, in peace and trust, without worries concerning certain injuries and enmities from which the man outside the community, the “man without peace,” is excluded—a German understands what “misery”  or êlend  originally means—and how people pledged themselves to and entered into obligations with the community bearing in mind precisely these injuries and enmities.  What will happen with an exception to this case? The community, the defrauded creditor, will see that it gets paid as well as it can—on that people can rely. The issue here is least of all the immediate damage which the offender has caused. Setting this to one side, the lawbreaker  is above all a “breaker” , a breaker of contracts and a breaker of his word against the totality, with respect to all the good features and advantages of the communal life in which, up to that point, he has had a share. The lawbreaker is a debtor who does not merely not pay back the benefits and advances given to him, but who even attacks his creditor. So from this point on not only does he forfeit, as is reasonable, all these good things and benefits—but he is also now reminded what these good things are all about. The anger of the injured creditor, the community, gives him back again to the wild outlawed condition, from which he was earlier protected. It pushes him away from itself—and now every form of hostility can vent itself on him. At this stage of cultural behaviour “punishment” is simply the copy, the mimus, of the normal conduct towards the hated, disarmed enemy  who has been thrown down, who has forfeited not only all legal rights and protection but also all mercy; hence it is a case of the rights of war and the victory celebration of vae victis  in all its ruthlessness and cruelty:—which accounts for the fact that war itself (including the warlike cult of sacrifice) has given us all the forms in which punishment has appeared in history.
10
As it acquires more power, a community no longer considers the crimes of the single individual so serious, because it no longer is entitled to consider him as dangerous and unsettling for the existence of the totality as much as it did before. The wrongdoer is no longer “outlawed” and thrown out, and the common anger is no longer permitted to vent itself on him without restraint to the same extent as earlier— instead the wrongdoer from now on is carefully protected by the community against this anger, especially from that of the immediately injured person, and is taken into protective custody. The compromise with the anger of those particularly affected by the wrong doing, and thus the effort to localize the case and to avert a wider or even a general participation and unrest, the attempts to find equivalents and to settle the whole business (the compositio), above all the desire, appearing with ever-increasing clarity, to consider every crime as, in some sense or other, capable of being paid off, and thus, at least to a certain extent, to separate the criminal and his crime from each other—those are the characteristics stamped more and more clearly on the further development of criminal law. If the power and the self-confidence of a community keep growing, the criminal law also grows constantly milder. Every weakening and deeper jeopardizing of the community brings its harsher forms of criminal law to light once again. The “creditor” has always became proportionally more humane as he has become richer. Finally the amount of his wealth even becomes measured by how much damage he can sustain without suffering from it. It would not be impossible to imagine a society with a consciousness of its own power which allowed itself the most privileged luxury which it can have—letting its criminals go without punishment. “Why should I really bother about my parasites?” it could then say. “May they live and prosper; for that I am still sufficiently strong!” . . . Justice, which started with “Everything is capable of being paid for; everything must be paid off” ends at that point, by shutting its eyes and letting the person incapable of payment go free—it ends, as every good thing on earth ends, by doing away with itself. This self-negation of justice: we know what a beautiful name it calls itself—mercy. It goes without saying that mercy remains the privilege of the most powerful man, or even better, his beyond the law.
11
A critical comment here about a recently published attempt to find the origin of justice in a completely different place—that is, in ressentiment. But first a word in the ear of the psychologists, provided that they have any desire to study ressentiment itself up close for once: this plant grows most beautifully nowadays among anarchists and anti-Semites; in addition, it blooms, as it always has, in hidden places, like the violet, although it has a different fragrance.* And since like always has to emerge necessarily from like, it is not surprising to see attempts coming forward again from just such circles, as they have already done many times before—see above, Section 14 —to sanctify revenge under the name of justice—as if justice were basically only a further development of a feeling of being injured—and to bring belated honour to reactive emotions generally, all of them, using the idea of revenge. With this last point I personally take the least offence. It even seems to me a service, so far as the entire biological problem is concerned (in connection with which the worth of those emotions has been underestimated up to now). The only thing I am calling attention to is the fact that it is the very spirit of ressentiment out of which this new emphasis on scientific fairness grows (which favours hate, envy, resentment, suspicion, rancour, and revenge). This “scientific fairness,” that is, ceases immediately and gives way to tones of mortal enmity and prejudice as soon as it deals with another group of emotions which, it strikes me, have a much higher biological worth than those reactive ones and which therefore have earned the right to be scientifically assessed and respected first—namely, the truly active emotions, like desire for mastery, acquisitiveness, and so on (E. Dühring, The Value of Life: A Course in Philosophy, the whole book really).* So much against this tendency in general. But in connection with Dühring’s single principle that we have to seek the homeland of justice in the land of the reactive feeling, we must, for love of the truth, rudely turn this around by setting out a different principle: the last territory to be conquered by the spirit of justice is the land of the reactive emotions! If it is truly the case that the just man remains just even towards someone who has injured him (and not merely cold, moderate, strange, indifferent: being just is always a positive attitude), if under the sudden attack of personal injury, ridicule, and suspicion, the gaze of the lofty, clear objectivity of the just and judging eye, as profound as it is benevolent, does not itself grow dark, well, that’s a piece of perfection and the highest mastery on earth—even something that it would be wise for people not to expect here; in any event, they should not believe in it too easily. It’s certainly true that, on average, among the most just people themselves even a small dose of hostility, malice, and insinuation is enough to make them see red and chase fairness out of their eyes. The active, aggressive, over-reaching human being is still placed a hundred steps closer to justice than the reactive person. For him it is simply not necessary in the slightest to estimate an object falsely and with bias, the way the reactive man does and must do. Thus, as a matter of fact, at all times the aggressive human being, as the stronger, braver, more noble man, has had on his side a better conscience as well as a more independent eye; by contrast, we can already guess who generally has the invention of “bad conscience” on his conscience—the man of ressentiment! Finally, let’s look around in history: up to now in what area has the whole implementation of law in general as well as the essential need for law been at home on earth? Could it be in the area of the reactive human beings? That is entirely wrong. It is much more the case that it’s been at home with the active, strong, spontaneous, and aggressive men. Historically considered, the law on earth—let me say this to the annoyance of the above-mentioned agitator (who once even confessed about himself “The doctrine of revenge runs through all my work and efforts as the red thread of justice”)—represents that very struggle against the reactive feelings, the war with them on the part of active and aggressive powers, which have partly used up their strength to put a halt to or to restrain the excess of reactive pathos and to compel some settlement with it. Wherever justice is practised, wherever justice is upheld, we see a stronger power in relation to a weaker power standing beneath it (whether with groups or individuals), seeking ways to bring an end among the latter to the senseless rage of ressentiment, partly by dragging the object of ressentiment out of the hands of revenge, partly by setting in the place of revenge a battle against the enemies of peace and order, partly by coming up with compensation, proposing it, under certain circumstances making it compulsory, partly by establishing certain equivalents for injuries as a norm, into which from now on ressentiment is directed once and for all. The most decisive factor, however, which the highest power carries out and sets in place against the superior numbers of the feelings of hostility and animosity—something that power always does as soon as it is somehow strong enough to do it—is to set up law, the imperative explanation of those things which, in its own eyes, are generally considered allowed and legal and things which are considered forbidden and illegal, while after the establishment of the law, the authorities treat attacks and arbitrary acts of individuals or entire groups as an outrage against the law, as rebellion against the highest power itself, and they steer the feeling of those beneath them away from the immediate damage caused by such outrages and thus, in the long run, achieve the reverse of what all revenge desires, which sees only the viewpoint of the injured party and considers only that valid. From now on, the eye becomes trained to evaluate actions always impersonally, even the eye of the harmed party itself (although this would be the very last thing to occur, as I have remarked earlier).—Consequently, only with the setting up of the law is there a “just” and “unjust” (and not, as Dühring will have it, from the time of the injurious action). To talk of just and unjust in themselves has no sense whatsoever; it’s obvious that in themselves harming, oppressing, exploiting, destroying cannot be “unjust,” inasmuch as life essentially works that way, that is, in its basic functions it harms, oppresses, exploits, and destroys, and cannot be conceived at all without this character. We have to acknowledge something even more disturbing: the fact that from the highest biological standpoint, conditions of justice must always be only exceptional conditions, partial restrictions on the basic will to live, which is set on power; they are subordinate to the total purpose of this will as individual means, that is, as means to create larger units of power. A legal system conceived of as sovereign and universal, not as a means in the struggle of power complexes, but as a means against all struggles in general, something along the lines of Dühring’s communist cliché in which each will must be considered as equal to every will, that would be a principle hostile to life, a destroyer and dissolver of human beings, an assassination attempt on the future of human beings, a sign of exhaustion, a secret path to nothingness.—
12
Here one more word concerning the origin and purpose of punishment—two problems which are separate or should be separate. Unfortunately people normally throw them together into one. How do the previous genealogists of morality deal with this issue? Naively—the way they have always worked. They find some “purpose” or other for punishment, for example, revenge or deterrence, then in a simple way set this purpose at the beginning as the causa fiendi  of punishment and—they’re finished. The “purpose in law,” however, is the very last idea we should use in the history of the emergence of law. It is much rather the case that for all forms of history there is no more important principle than that one which we reach with such difficulty but which we also really should reach—namely that what causes a particular thing to arise and the final utility of that thing, its actual use and arrangement in a system of purposes, are separate toto coelo  from each other, that something existing, which has somehow come to its present state, will again and again be interpreted by the higher power over it from a new perspective, appropriated in a new way, reorganized for and redirected to new uses, that all events in the organic world involve overpowering, acquiring mastery and that, in turn, all overpowering and acquiring mastery involve a new interpretation, a readjustment, in which the “sense” and “purpose” up to then must necessarily be obscured or entirely erased. No matter how well we have understood the usefulness of some physiological organ or other (or a legal institution, a social custom, a political practice, some style in the arts or in a religious cult), we have still not, in that process, grasped anything about its origin—no matter how uncomfortable and unpleasant this may sound in elderly ears. From time immemorial people have believed that in demonstrable purposes, in the usefulness of a thing, a form, or an institution, they could also understand the reason it came into existence—the eye as something made to see, the hand as something made to grasp. So people also imagined punishment as invented to punish. But all purposes, all uses, are only signs that a will to power has become master over something with less power and has stamped on it its own meaning of some function, and the entire history of a “thing,” an organ, a practice can by this process be seen as a continuing chain of signs of constantly new interpretations and adjustments, whose causes do not even need to be connected to each other—in some circumstances they rather follow and take over from each other by chance. Consequently, the “development” of a thing, a practice, or an organ has nothing to do with its progressus  towards a single goal, even less is it the logical and shortest progressus reached with the least expenditure of power and resources—but rather the sequence of more or less profound, more or less mutually independent processes of overpowering which take place on that thing, together with the resistance which arises against that overpowering each time, the changes of form which have been attempted for the purpose of defence and reaction, as well as the results of successful counter-measures. Form is fluid; the “meaning,” however, is even more so. . . . Even within each individual organism things are no different: with every essential growth in the totality, the “meaning” of the individual organ also shifts—in certain circumstances its partial destruction, a reduction of its numbers (for example, through the obliteration of intermediate structures) can be a sign of growing power and perfection. What I wanted to say is this: the partial loss of utility, decline, and degeneration, the loss of meaning, and purposiveness, in short, death, also belong to the conditions of a real progressus , which always appears in the form of a will and a way to a greater power and always establishes itself at the expense of a huge number of smaller powers. The size of a “step forward” can even be estimated by a measure of everything that had to be sacrificed to it. The humanity as mass sacrificed for the benefit of a single stronger species of man— that would be a step forward . . . . I emphasize this major point of view about historical methodology all the more since it basically runs counter to the very instinct which presently rules and to contemporary taste, which would rather still go along with the absolute contingency, even the mechanical meaninglessness, of all events rather than with the theory of a will to power playing itself out in everything that happens.  The democratic idiosyncrasy of being hostile to everything which rules and wants to rule, the modern hatred of rulers  (to make up a bad word for a bad thing) has gradually transformed itself into and dressed itself up as something spiritual, of the highest spirituality, to such an extent that nowadays step by step it is already infiltrating the strictest, apparently most objective scientific research, and is allowed to infiltrate it. Indeed, it seems to me already to have attained mastery over all of physiology and the understanding of life, to their detriment, as is obvious, because it has conjured away from them their fundamental concept, that of real activity. By contrast, under the pressure of this idiosyncrasy we push “adaptation” into the foreground, that is, a second-order activity, a mere reactivity; in fact, people have defined life itself as an always purposeful inner adaptation to external circumstances (Herbert Spencer). But that simply misjudges the essence of life, its will to power. That overlooks the first priority of the spontaneous, aggressive, over-reaching, re-interpreting, re-directing, and shaping powers, after whose effects the “adaptation” then follows. Thus, the governing role of the highest functions in an organism itself, the ones in which the will for living appear active and creative, are denied. People should remember the criticism Huxley directed at Spencer for his “administrative nihilism.” But the issue here concerns much more than “administration.” . . .*

Returning to the business at hand, that is, to punishment, we have to differentiate between two aspects of it: first its relative duration, the way it is carried out, the action, the “drama,” a certain strict sequence of procedures and, on the other hand, its fluidity, the meaning, the purpose, the expectation linked to the implementation of such procedures. In this matter, we can here assume, without further comment, per analogium , in accordance with the major viewpoints about the historical method we have just established, that the procedure itself will be somewhat older and earlier than its use as a punishment, that the latter was only first injected and interpreted into the procedure (which had been present for a long time but was a custom with a different meaning), in short, that it was not what our naive genealogists of morality and law up to now have assumed, who collectively imagined that the procedure was invented for the purpose of punishment, just as people earlier thought that the hand was invented for the purpose of grasping. Now, so far as that other element in punishment is concerned, the fluid element, its “meaning,” in a very late cultural state (for example in contemporary Europe) the idea of “punishment” actually presents not simply one meaning but a whole synthesis of “meanings.” The history of punishment up to now, in general, the history of its use for different purposes, finally crystallizes into a sort of unity, which is difficult to untangle, difficult to analyze, and, it must be stressed, totally incapable of definition. (Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really punish; all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude definition. Only something which has no history is capable of being defined). At an earlier stage, by contrast, that synthesis of “meanings” still appears easier to untangle, as well as even easier to adjust. We can still see how in every individual case the elements in the synthesis alter their valence and rearrange themselves accordingly, so that soon this or that element steps forward and dominates at the expense of the rest; indeed, under certain circumstances one element (say, the purpose of deterrence) appears to rise above all the other elements. In order to give at least an idea of how uncertain, how belated, how accidental “the meaning” of punishment is and how one and the same procedure can be used, interpreted, or adjusted for fundamentally different purposes, let me offer here an example which presented itself to me on the basis of relatively little random material: punishment as a way of rendering someone harmless, as a prevention from further harm; punishment as compensation for the damage to the person injured, in some form or other (also in the form of emotional compensation); punishment as isolation of some upset to an even balance in order to avert a wider outbreak of the disturbance; punishment as way of inspiring fear of those who determine and carry out punishment; punishment as a sort of compensation for the advantages which the law breaker has enjoyed up until that time (for example, when he is made useful as a slave working in the mines); punishment as a cutting out of a degenerate element (in some circumstances an entire branch, as in Chinese law, and thus a means to keep the race pure or to sustain a social type); punishment as festival, that is, as the violation and humiliation of some enemy one has finally thrown down; punishment as a way of making a conscience, whether for the man who suffers the punishment— so- called “reform”—or whether for those who witness the punishment being carried out; punishment as the payment of an honorarium, set as a condition by those in power, which protects the wrong doer from the excesses of revenge; punishment as a compromise with the natural condition of revenge, insofar as the latter is still upheld and assumed as a privilege by powerful families; punishment as a declaration of war and a war measure against an enemy to peace, law, order, and authority, which people fight with the very measures war makes available, as something dangerous to the community, as a breach of contract with respect to its conditions, as a rebel, traitor, and breaker of the peace.
14
Of course, this list is not complete. Obviously punishment is overloaded with all sorts of useful purposes, all the more reason why people can infer from it an alleged utility, which, in the popular consciousness at least, is considered its most essential one—faith in punishment, which nowadays for several reasons is getting shaky, still finds its most powerful support in precisely that. Punishment is supposed to be valuable in waking the feeling of guilt in the guilty party. In punishment people are looking for the actual instrument for that psychic reaction called “bad conscience,” “pangs of conscience.” But in doing this, people are misappropriating reality and psychology, even for today, and how much more for the longest history of man, his prehistory! Real pangs of conscience are something extremely rare, especially among criminals and prisoners. Prisons and penitentiaries are not breeding grounds in which this species of gnawing worm particularly likes to thrive:—on that point all conscientious observers agree, in many cases delivering such a judgment with sufficient unwillingness, going against their own desires. In general, punishment makes people hard and cold. It concentrates. It sharpens the feeling of estrangement; it strengthens powers of resistance. If it comes about that punishment shatters a man’s energy and brings on a wretched prostration and self-abasement, such a consequence is surely even less pleasant than the typical result of punishment, characteristically a dry, gloomy seriousness. However, if we consider those thousands of years before the history of humanity, without a second thought we can conclude that the very development of a feeling of guilt was most powerfully hindered by punishment—at least with respect to the victims onto whom this force of punishment was vented. For let us not underestimate just how much the criminal is prevented by the very sight of judicial and executive procedures themselves from sensing that his act, the nature of his action, is something inherently reprehensible, for he sees exactly the same kind of actions committed in the service of justice, then applauded and practised in good conscience, like espionage, lying, bribery, entrapment, the whole tricky and sly art of the police and prosecution, as it manifests itself in the various kinds of punishment—the robbery, oppression, abuse, imprisonment, torture, murder, all done, moreover, as a matter of principle, without even any emotional involvement as an excuse— all these actions are in no way rejected or condemned in themselves by his judges, but only in particular respects when used for certain purposes. “Bad conscience,” this most creepy and most interesting plant among our earthly vegetation, did not grow in this soil—in fact, for the longest period in the past nothing about dealing with a “guilty party” penetrated the consciousness of judges or even those doing the punishing. By contrast, they were dealing with someone who had caused harm, with an irresponsible piece of fate. And even the man on whom punishment later fell, once again like a piece of fate, experienced in that no “inner pain,” other than what might have come from the sudden arrival of something unpredictable, a terrible natural event, a falling, crushing boulder against which there is no way to fight any more.
15
At one point Spinoza became aware of this issue in an incriminating way (something which irritates his interpreters, like Kuno Fischer, who really go to great lengths to misunderstand him on this matter), when one afternoon, he came up against some memory or other (who knows what?) and pondered the question about what, as far as he was concerned, was left of the celebrated morsus conscientiae —for him, the man who had expelled good and evil into human fantasies and had irascibly defended the honour of his “free” God against those blasphemers who claimed that in everything God worked sub ratione boni  (“but that means that God would be subordinate to Fate, a claim which, in truth, would be the greatest of all contradictions”). For Spinoza the world had gone back again into that state of innocence in which it had existed before the invention of bad conscience. So with that what, then, had become of the morsus conscientiae? “The opposite of gaudium ,” Spinoza finally told himself “is sorrow, accompanied by the image of something over and done with which happened contrary to all expectation” (Ethics III, Proposition XVIII, Schol. I. II). In a manner no different from Spinoza’s, those instigating evil who incurred punishment have for thousands of years felt, so far as their “crime” is concerned, “Something has unexpectedly gone awry here,” not “I should not have done that”—they submitted to their punishment as people submit to a sickness or some bad luck or death, with that brave fatalism free of revolt which, for example, even today gives the Russians an advantage over us westerners in coping with life. If back then there was some criticism of the act, such criticism came from prudence: without question we must seek the essential effect of punishment above all in an increase of prudence, in an extension of memory, in a will to go to work from now on more carefully, more mistrustfully, more secretly, with the awareness that we are in many things definitely too weak, in a kind of improved ability to judge ourselves. In general, what can be achieved through punishment, in human beings and animals, is an increase in fear, a honing of prudence, control over desires. In the process, punishment tames human beings, but it does not make them “better”—people could with more justification assert the opposite. (Popular wisdom says “Injury makes people prudent,” but to the extent that it makes them prudent, it also makes them bad. Fortunately, often enough it makes people stupid).
16
At this point, I can no longer avoid setting out, in an initial, provisional statement, my own hypothesis about the origin of “bad conscience.” It is not easy to get people to attend to it, and it requires them to consider it at length, to guard it, and to sleep on it. I consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings had to come down with under the pressure of that most fundamental of all the changes which they ever experienced—that change when they finally found themselves locked within the confines of society and peace. Just like the things water animals must have gone though when they were forced either to become land animals or to die off, so events must have played themselves out with this half-beast so happily adapted to the wilderness, war, wandering around, adventure—suddenly all its instincts were devalued and “disengaged.” From this point on, these animals were to go on foot and “carry themselves”; whereas previously they had been supported by the water. A terrible heaviness weighed them down. In performing the simplest things they felt ungainly. In dealing with this new unknown world, they no longer had their old leaders, the ruling unconscious drives which guided them safely—these unfortunate creatures were reduced to thinking, inferring, calculating, bringing together cause and effect, reduced to their “consciousness,” their most impoverished and error-prone organ! I believe that never on earth has there been such a feeling of misery, such a leaden discomfort—while at the same time those old instincts had not all of a sudden stopped imposing their demands! Only it was difficult and seldom possible to do their bidding. For the most part, they had to find new and, as it were, underground satisfactions for themselves. All instincts which are not discharged to the outside are turned back inside—this is what I call the internalization  of man. From this first grows in man what people later call his “soul.” The entire inner world, originally as thin as if stretched between two layers of skin, expanded and extended itself, acquired depth, width, and height, to the extent that what a person discharged out into the world was obstructed. Those frightening fortifications with which the organization of the state protected itself against the old instincts for freedom—punishments belong above all to these fortifications—brought it about that all those instincts of the wild, free, roaming man turned themselves backwards, against man himself. Enmity, cruelty, joy in pursuit, in attack, in change, in destruction—all those turned themselves against the possessors of such instincts. That is the origin of “bad conscience.” The man who, because of a lack of external enemies and opposition, was forced into an oppressive narrowness and regularity of custom impatiently tore himself apart, persecuted himself, gnawed away at himself, grew upset, and did himself damage—this animal which scraped itself raw against the bars of its cage, which people want to “tame,” this impoverished creature, consumed with longing for the wild, which had to create out of its own self an adventure, a torture chamber, an uncertain and dangerous wilderness—this fool, this yearning and puzzled prisoner, became the inventor of “bad conscience.” But with him was introduced the greatest and weirdest illness, from which humanity up to the present time has not recovered, the suffering of man from man, from himself, a consequence of the forcible separation from his animal past, a leap and, so to speak, a fall into new situations and living conditions, a declaration of war against the old instincts, on which, up to that point, his power, joy, and ability to inspire fear had been based. Let us at once add that, on the other hand, the fact that there was on earth an animal soul turned against itself, taking sides against itself, meant there was something so new, profound, unheard of, enigmatic, contradictory, and full of the future, that with it the picture of the earth was fundamentally changed. In fact, it required divine spectators to appreciate the dramatic performance which then began and whose conclusion is by no means yet in sight—a spectacle too fine, too wonderful, too paradoxical, to be allowed to play itself out senselessly and unobserved on some ridiculous star or other! Since then man has been included among the most unexpected and most thrillingly lucky rolls of the dice in the game played by Heraclitus’ “great child,” whether he’s called Zeus or chance.* For himself he arouses a certain interest, a tension, a hope, almost a certainty, as if something is announcing itself with him, something is preparing itself, as if the human being were not the goal but only a way, an episode, a bridge, a great promise . . .
17
Inherent in this hypothesis about the origin of bad conscience is, firstly, the assumption that the change was not gradual or voluntary and did not manifest itself as an organic growth into new conditions, but as a break, a leap, something forced, an irrefutable disaster, against which there was no struggle nor even any ressentiment. Secondly, however, it assumes that the adaptation of a populace hitherto unchecked and shapeless into a fixed form, just as it was initiated by an act of violence, was carried to its conclusion by nothing but acts of violence—that consequently the oldest “State” emerged as a terrible tyranny, as an oppressive and inconsiderate machinery, and continued working until such raw materials of people and half-animals finally were not only thoroughly kneaded and submissive but also given a shape. I used the word “State”: it is self-evident who is meant by that term—some pack of blond predatory animals, a race of conquerors and masters, which, organized for war and with the power to organize, without thinking about it, sets its terrifying paws on a subordinate population which may perhaps be vast in numbers but is still without any form, is still wandering about. That is, in fact, the way the “State” begins on earth. I believe that fantasy has been done away with which sees the beginning of the state in a “contract.” The man who can command, who is by nature a “master,” who comes forward with violence in his actions and gestures—what has he to do with making contracts! We do not negotiate with such beings. They come like fate, without cause, reason, consideration, or pretext. They are present as lightning is present, too fearsome, too sudden, too convincing, too “different” even to become merely hated. Their work is the instinctive creation of forms, the imposition of forms. They are the most involuntary and most unconscious artists in existence:—where they appear something new is soon present, a power structure which lives, something in which the parts and functions are demarcated and coordinated, in which there is, in general, no place for anything which does not first derive its “meaning” from its relationship to the totality. These men, these born organizers, have no idea what guilt, responsibility, and consideration are. In them that fearsome egotism of the artist is in charge, which stares out like bronze and knows how to justify itself for all time in the “work,” just as a mother does in her child. They are not the ones in whom “bad conscience” grew—that point is obvious from the outset. But this hateful plant would not have grown without them. It would have failed if an immense amount of freedom had not been driven from the world under the pressure of their hammer blows, their artistic violence, or at least had not been driven from sight and, as it were, made latent. This powerful instinct for freedom, once made latent—we already understand how—this instinct for freedom driven back, repressed, imprisoned inside, and finally still able to discharge and direct itself only against itself—that and that alone is what bad conscience is in its beginning.
18
We need to be careful not to entertain a low opinion of this entire phenomenon simply because it is from the start nasty and painful. In fact, it is basically the same active force which is at work on a grander scale in those artists of power and organizers and which builds states. Here it is inner, smaller, more mean spirited, directing itself backwards, into “the labyrinth of the breast,” to use Goethe’s words, and it creates bad conscience for itself and builds negative ideals, just that instinct for freedom (to use my own language, the will to power). Only the material on which the shaping and violating nature of this force directs itself here is simply man himself, his entire old animal self— and not, as in that greater and more striking phenomenon, on another man or on other men. This furtive violation of the self, this artistic cruelty, this pleasure in giving a shape to oneself as a tough, resisting, suffering material, to burn into it a will, a critique, a contradiction, a contempt, a denial, this weird and horribly pleasurable work of a soul willingly divided against itself, which makes itself suffer for the pleasure of creating suffering, all this active “bad conscience,” as the essential womb of ideal and imaginative events, finally brought to light —we have already guessed—also an abundance of strange new beauty and affirmation and perhaps for the first time the idea of the beautiful in general. . . . For what would be “beautiful,” if its opposite had not yet come to an awareness of itself, if ugliness had not already said to itself, “I am ugly”? At least, after this hint the paradox will be less puzzling, the extent to which in contradictory ideas, like selflessness, self-denial, self-sacrifice, an ideal can be indicated, something beautiful. And beyond that, one thing we do know—I have no doubt about it—namely, the nature of the pleasure which the selfless, self-denying, self-sacrificing person experiences from the beginning: this pleasure belongs to cruelty. So much for the moment on the origin of the “un-egoistic” as something of moral worth and on the demarcation of the soil out of which this value has grown: only bad conscience, only the will to abuse the self, provides the condition for the value of the un-egoistic.
19
Bad conscience is a sickness—there’s no doubt about that—but a sickness the way pregnancy is a sickness. Let’s look for the conditions in which this illness has arrived at its most terrible and most sublime peak:—in this way we’ll see what really brought about its entry into the world at the start. But that requires a lot of endurance—and we must first go back once more to an earlier point of view. The relationship in civil law between the debtor and his creditor, which I have reviewed extensively already, has been interpreted once again in an extremely remarkable and dubious historical manner into a relationship which we modern men are perhaps least capable of understanding, namely, into the relationship between those people presently alive and their ancestors. Within the original tribal cooperatives—we’re talking about primeval times—the living generation always acknowledged a legal obligation to the previous generations, and especially to the earliest one which had founded the tribe (and this was in no way merely a sentimental obligation: the latter is something we could even reasonably claim was, in general, absent for the longest period of the human race). Here the reigning conviction is that the tribe exists at all only because of the sacrifices and achievements of its ancestors—and that people have to pay them back with sacrifices and achievements.  In this people recognize a debt which keeps steadily growing because these ancestors in their continuing existence as powerful spirits do not stop giving the tribe new advantages and lending them their power. Do they do this gratuitously? But there is no “gratuitously” for those raw and “spiritually destitute” ages. What can people give back to them? Sacrifices (at first as nourishment understood very crudely), festivals, chapels, signs of honour, above all, obedience—for all customs, as work of one’s ancestors, are also their statutes and commands. Do people ever give them enough? This suspicion remains and grows. From time to time it forcefully requires a huge wholesale redemption, something immense as a repayment  to the “creditor” (the notorious sacrifice of the first born, for example, blood, human blood in any case). The fear of ancestors and their power, the awareness of one’s debt to them, according to this kind of logic, necessarily increases directly in proportion to the increase in the power of the tribe itself, as the tribe finds itself constantly more victorious, more independent, more honoured, and more feared. It’s not the other way around! Every step towards the decline of the tribe, all conditions of misery, all indications of degeneration, of approaching dissolution, rather lead to a constant lessening of the fear of the spirit of its founder and give a constantly smaller image of his wisdom, providence, and powerful presence. If we think this crude form of logic through to its conclusion, then the ancestors of the most powerful tribes must, because of the fantasy of increasing fear, finally have grown into something immense and have been pushed back into the darkness of a divine mystery, something beyond the powers of imagination, so that finally the ancestor is necessarily transfigured into a god. Here perhaps lies even the origin of the gods, thus an origin out of fear! . . . And the man to whom it seems obligatory to add “But also out of piety” could hardly claim to be right for the longest period of the human race, for his primaeval age. Of course, he would be all the more correct for the middle period, in which the noble tribes developed—those who in fact paid back to their founders, their ancestors (heroes, gods), with interest, all the characteristics which in the meantime had become manifest in themselves, the noble qualities. Later we will have another look at the process by which the gods were ennobled and exalted (which is naturally not at all the same thing as their becoming “holy”). But now, for the moment, let’s follow the path of this whole development of the consciousness of guilt to its conclusion.
20
As history teaches us, the consciousness of being in debt to the gods did not in any way come to an end after the downfall of the organization of the “community” based on blood relationships. Just as humanity inherited the ideas of “good and bad” from the nobility of the tribe (together with its fundamental psychological tendency to set up orders of rank), in the same way people also inherited, as well as the divinities of the tribe and of the extended family, the pressure of as yet unpaid debts and the desire to be relieved of them. (The transition is made with those numerous slave and indentured populations which adapted themselves to the divine cults of their masters, whether through compulsion or through obsequiousness and mimicry; from them this inheritance then overflowed in all directions). The feeling of being indebted to the gods did not stop growing for several thousands of years, always, in fact, in direct proportion to the extent to which the idea of god and the feeling for god grew on earth and were carried to the heights. (The entire history of ethnic fighting, victory, reconciliation, mergers, everything which comes before the final rank ordering of all the elements of a people in every great racial synthesis, is mirrored in the tangled genealogies of its gods, in the sagas of their fights, victories, and reconciliations. The progress towards universal empires is always also the progress toward universal divinities. In addition, despotism, with its overthrow of the independent nobility always builds the way to some variety of monotheism). The arrival of the Christian god, as the greatest  god which has yet been reached, thus brought about the maximum feeling of indebtedness on earth. Assuming that we have gradually set out in the reverse direction, we can infer with no small probability that, given the inexorable decline of faith in the Christian god, even now there may already be a considerable decline in the human consciousness of guilt. Indeed, we cannot dismiss the idea that the complete and final victory of atheism could release humanity from this entire feeling of being indebted to its origin, its causa prima . Atheism and a kind of second innocence belong together.—
21
So much for a brief and rough preface concerning the connection between the ideas “guilt” and “obligation” with religious assumptions. Up to this point I have deliberately set aside the actual moralizing of these ideas (the repression of them into the conscience, or more precisely, the complex interaction of the bad conscience with the idea of god). At the end of the previous section I even talked as if there were no such thing as this moralizing and thus as if those ideas were now necessarily coming to an end after the collapse of their presuppositions, the faith in our “creditor,” in God. But to a terrifying extent the facts indicate something different. The moralizing of the ideas of debt and duty, with their repression into the bad conscience, actually gave rise to the attempt to reverse the direction of the development I have just described, or at least to bring its motion to a halt. Now, in a fit of pessimism, the prospect of a final installment must once and for all be denied; now, our gaze must bounce and ricochet back despairingly off an iron impossibility, now those ideas of “debt” and “duty” must  turn back. But against whom? There can be no doubt: first of all against the “debtor,” in whom from this point on bad conscience sets itself firmly, gnaws away, spreads out, and, like a polyp, grows wide and deep to such an extent that finally, with the impossibility of discharging the debt, people also come up with the notion that it is impossible to remove the penance, the idea that it cannot be paid off (“eternal punishment”):—finally however, those ideas of “debt” and “duty” turn back even against the “creditor.” People should, in this matter, now think about the causa prima  of humanity, about the beginning of the human race, about their ancestor who from now on is loaded down with a curse (“Adam,” “original sin,” “no freedom of the will”) or about nature from whose womb human beings arose and into which the principle of evil is now inserted (“the demonizing of nature”) or about existence in general, which remains something inherently without value  (nihilistic turning away from existence, longing for nothingness, or a desire for its “opposite,” in an alternate state of being, Buddhism and things like that)—until all of a sudden we confront the paradoxical and horrifying expedient with which a martyred humanity found temporary relief, that stroke of genius of Christianity: God sacrificing himself for the guilt of human beings, God paying himself back with himself, God as the only one who can redeem man from what for human beings has become impossible to redeem—the creditor sacrificing himself for the debtor, out of love (can people believe that?), out of love for his debtor! . . .
22
You will already have guessed what really went on with all this and under all this: that will to self-torment, that repressed cruelty of animal man pushed inward and forced back into himself, imprisoned in the “state” to make him tame, who invented bad conscience in order to lacerate himself, after the more natural discharge of this will to inflict pain had been blocked—this man of bad conscience seized upon religious assumptions to drive his self-torment to its most horrifying hardship and ferocity. Guilt towards God: this idea becomes his instrument of torture. In “God” he seizes on the ultimate contrast he is capable of discovering to his real and indissoluble animal instincts. He interprets these animal instincts themselves as a crime against God (as enmity, rebellion, revolt against the “master,” the “father,” the original ancestor and beginning of the world). He grows tense with the contradiction of “God” and “devil.” He hurls from himself every “No” which he says to himself, to nature, naturalness, the factual reality  of his being as a “Yes,” as something existing, as living, as real, as God, as the blessedness of God, as God the Judge, as God the Hangman, as something beyond him, as eternity, as perpetual torment, as hell, as punishment and guilt beyond measure. In this spiritual cruelty there is a kind of insanity of the will which simply has no equal: a man’s will finding him so guilty and reprehensible that there is no atonement, his will to imagine himself punished, but in such a way that the punishment could never be adequate for his crime, his will to infect and poison the most fundamental basis of things with the problem of punishment and guilt in order to cut himself off once and for all from any exit out of this labyrinth of “fixed ideas,” his will to erect an ideal—that of the “holy God”—in order to be tangibly certain of his own absolute worthlessness when confronted with it. O this insane, sad beast man! What ideas it has, what unnaturalness, what paroxysms of nonsense, what bestiality of thought breaks from it as soon as it is prevented, if only a little, from being a beast in deed! . . . All this is excessively interesting, but there’s also a black, gloomy, unnerving sadness about it, so that man must forcefully hold himself back from gazing too long into these abysses. Here we have illness  — no doubt about that—the most terrifying illness that has raged in human beings up to now:—and anyone who can still hear (but nowadays people no longer have the ear for that!—) how in this night of torment and insanity the cry of love has resounded, the cry of the most yearning delight, of redemption through love, turns away, seized by an invincible horror. . . In human beings there is so much that is terrible! . . . The world has already been a lunatic asylum for too long!
23
These remarks should be sufficient, once and for all, concerning the origin of the “holy God.”—The fact that conceiving gods does not necessarily, in itself, have to lead to this degraded imagination, that’s something we could not excuse ourselves from recalling for a moment, the point that there are more uplifting ways to use the invention of the gods than for this human self-crucifixion and self-laceration, in which Europe in the last millennia has become an expert—fortunately that’s something we can still infer with every glance we cast at the Greek gods, these reflections of nobler men, more rulers of themselves, in whom the animal in man felt himself deified and did not tear himself apart, did not rage against himself! These Greeks for the longest time used their gods for the very purpose of keeping that “bad conscience” at a distance, in order to be permitted to continue enjoying their psychic freedom. Hence, their understanding was the opposite of how Christianity used its God. In this matter the Greeks went a very long way, these splendid and lion-hearted Greeks, with their child-like minds. And no lesser authority than that of Homer’s Zeus himself now and then lets them understand that they are making things too easy for themselves. “It’s strange,” he says at one point in relation to the case of Aegisthus, a very bad case—
It’s strange how these mortal creatures complain about the gods!
Evil comes only from us, they claim, but they themselves
Stupidly make themselves miserable, even contrary to fate.*
But at the same time we hear and see that even this Olympian spectator and judge is far from being irritated and from thinking them evil because of this: “How foolish they are,” he thinks in relation to the bad deeds of mortal men—and even the Greeks of the strongest and bravest times conceded that much about themselves—the “foolishness,” “stupidity,” a little “disturbance in the head” were the basis for many bad and fateful things—foolishness, not sin! Do you understand that? . . . But even this disturbance in the head was a problem, “Indeed, how is this even possible? Where could this have really come from in heads like the ones we have, we men of noble descent, happy, successful, from the best society, noble, and virtuous?”—for hundreds of years the aristocratic Greek posed this question to himself in relation to every horror or outrage incomprehensible to him which had defiled one of his peers. “Some god must have deluded him,” he finally said, shaking his head . . . This solution is typical of the Greeks . . . In this way, the gods then served to justify men to a certain extent, even in bad things. They served as the origins of evil—at that time the gods took upon themselves, not punishment, but, what is nobler, the guilt. . .
24
—I’ll conclude with three question marks—that’s clear enough. You may perhaps ask me, “Is an ideal actually being built up here or shattered?” . . . But have you ever really asked yourself enough how high a price has been paid on earth for the construction of every ideal? How much reality had to be constantly vilified and misunderstood for that to happen, how many lies had to be consecrated, how many consciences corrupted, how much “god” had to be sacrificed every time? In order to enable a shrine to be built, a shrine must be destroyed: that is the law—show me the case where it has not been fulfilled! We modern men, we are the inheritors of thousands of years of vivisection of the conscience and self-inflicted animal torture. That’s what we have had the longest practice doing, that is perhaps our artistry; in any case, it’s something we have refined, the corruption of our taste. For too long man has looked at his natural inclinations with an “evil eye,” so that finally in him they have become twinned with “bad conscience.” An attempt to reverse this might, in itself, be possible—but who is strong enough for it, that is, to link as siblings bad conscience and the unnatural inclinations, all those aspirations for what lies beyond, those things which go against our senses, against our instincts, against nature, against animals—in short, the earlier ideals, all the ideals which are hostile to life, ideals of those who vilify the world? To whom can we turn to today with such hopes and demands? . . .  In this we would have precisely the good people against us, as well, of course, as the comfortable, the complacent, the vain, the enthusiastic, the tired. . . .  But what is more deeply offensive, what cuts us off so fundamentally, as letting them take some note of the severity and loftiness with which  we deal with ourselves? And, by contrast, how obliging, how friendly all the world is in relation to us, as soon as we act as all the world does and “let ourselves go” just like all the world! To attain the goal I’m talking about requires a different sort of spirit from those which are likely to exist at this particular time: spirits empowered by war and victory, for whom conquest, adventure, danger, and even pain have become a need. That would require getting acclimatized to keen, high air, winter wanderings, to ice and mountains in every sense. That would require even a kind of sublime maliciousness, an ultimate self-conscious wilfulness of knowledge, which comes with great health. Simply and seriously put, that would require just this great health! . . . Is this even possible today? . . . But at some time or other, in a more powerful time than this mouldy, self-doubting present, he must nonetheless come to us, the redeeming man of great love and contempt, the creative spirit, constantly pushed again and again away from every sideline or from the beyond by his own driving power, whose isolation is misunderstood by people as if it were a flight from reality—whereas it is only his immersion, burial, and absorption in reality, so that once he comes out of it into the light again, he brings home the redemption of this reality, its redemption from the curse which the previous ideal has laid upon it. This man of the future, who will release us from that earlier ideal just as much as from what had to grow from it, from the great loathing, from the will to nothingness, from nihilism—that stroke of noon and of the great decision which makes the will free once again, who gives back to the earth its purpose and to the human being his hope, this anti-Christ and anti-nihilist, this conqueror of God and of nothingness—at some point he must come . . .

But what am I talking about here? Enough, enough! At this stage there’s only one thing appropriate for me to do: keep quiet. Otherwise, I’ll make the mistake of arrogating to myself something which only someone younger is free to do, someone “more of the future,” someone more powerful than I am—something which only Zarathustra is free to do, Zarathustra the Godless . . . .*

Nietzsche quotes the Latin: “si plus minusve secuerunt, ne fraude esto.” 
Spinoza: Baruch de Spinoza (1632-1677), important Dutch rationalist philosopher. 
Pope Innocent III: (1161-1216), an important and powerful medieval Pope. 
. . . ressentiment: As mentioned above (in the First Essay), Nietzsche uses this French word, which since his writing, and largely because of it, has entered the English language as an important term in psychology: a short definition is as follows: “deep-seated resentment, frustration, and hostility, accompanied by a sense of being powerless to express these feelings directly” (Merriam-Webster). Ressentiment is thus significantly different in meaning from resentment. 
E. Dühring: (1833-1921), German philosopher and economist.  
Herbert Spencer: (1820-1903), English philosopher who advanced the idea of evolution as a progressive process in society. Huxley: Thomas Huxley (1825-1895): a major English champion of Darwin’s evolutionary ideas. 
Heraclitus: (c. 535-475 BC) an important pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. 
Zeus makes these remarks to the other Olympian gods at the start of Homer’s Odyssey. Aegisthus seduced Clytaemnestra, and the two of them murdered Agamemnon, her husband, as soon as he returned home from the Trojan War. The gods, according to Homer, had warned him against these actions. 
Zarathustra: a name for the Persian prophet Zoroaster, which Nietzsche appropriates to designate a spokesman for his own ideas. "

Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh, how real
Those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart

She's just so black!""

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!"

Take a deep a breath, and now I'm fine
Beat beating like my heart
Been the same from the start
Just a young fucking punk
With some hate inside my heart
Teardrops while I'm smiling
Probably laughing while I'm dying
I be coughin' to the coffin
I be rhyming till' I'm Audi

Bucket hats, bucket seeds

You can't do it like me
Got a hundred and one bitches and they all like me
That's gorgeous, flawless, they fuck me while I'm flowin'
The skinny white pimp, I'm the motherfucker ownin'
The weeds and seeds and It's creepin' up on the trees
And the leaves, they be fallin'
Breaking up on the concrete
You ride for your team
Say you lying through your teeth
You could sell a million records and still never be me
Bitch aw, you praying
I look at you like you playing
You talking to the sky like you gone get an answer
Here's an answer for your question
If you trying to get a lesson
Take a seat and fucking listen

Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

Satisfy You,puff daddy ,1999,1990,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier


Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true


Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you
 until fade

This one right here goes out to all my sisters"

And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile

Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you

Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,the spinners,1973,1970,"Since I met you
I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name
That's funny
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do
Each night I pray
There will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too
And I wonder what
It is I feel for you

Run Joey Run,david geddes,1975,1970,"Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see
Every night, the same old dream
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry
She called me up, late that night
She said, ""Joe, don't come over
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door!
I've never seen him act this way
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done
He's got a gun!
So run, Joey run, Joey run!""
Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see
Got in my car
And I drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me
With tear-filled eyes and bruises on her face
All at once
I saw him there sneaking up behind me
(Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, ""He's got a gun!""
And she stepped in front of me
Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling!
I ran to her
I held her close
When I looked down
My hands were red
And here's the last words Julie said
Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gon...na get... mar...ried......
Run, Joey run, Joey, run
Joey, run, Joey, run
Joey, run, Joey, ruuuuuunn!!!"
Black Water,the doobie brothers,1975,1970,"Well, I built me a raft and she's ready for floating

Sundown,gordon lightfoot,1974,1970,"I can see her lyin' back
In her satin dress
In a room where you do
What you don't confess
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
She's been lookin' like a queen
In a sailor's dream
And she don't always say
What she really means
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
I can picture every move
That a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin'
Is your first mistake
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again
I can see her lookin' fast
In her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman
Got me feelin' mean
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again"

A Whiter Shade Of Pale,procol harum,1967,1960,"We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale"

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist

Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Aww honey, all I ever need is you
You're my first love you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask
Aww honey, all I ever need is you
Winters come and they go
And we watch the melting snow
But sure as summer follows spring
All the things you do
Give me a reason to spend me life
Around you...
Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
But I have found my treasure in your soul
My honey, all I ever need is you...
Without our love, I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my Honey
All I ever need is you"

"Stay (I Missed You) (From ""Reality Bites"")",lisa loeb ,1994,1990,"CUDDY: Dr. Riley is throwing up; he obviously can’t lecture
HOUSE: You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it? I think I’m coming down with a little bit of the clap. I may have to go home for a few days.
CUDDY:  Dr. Riley doesn’t have a history of lying to me.
HOUSE: You said this is the fifth time he’s missed a class this year! Either he’s dying or he’s lying.
CUDDY: I’ll give you two hours off clinic duty.
HOUSE: Fine, I’ll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. *He starts to walk off*
CUDDY: You’ll do it.
HOUSE:  Why is it always me?
CUDDY: Because the world hates you. Or because it’s a class on diagnostics. Pick whatever reason feeds your narcissism better.
HOUSE: I’m not doing it.  You’re supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.
CUDDY: Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.
HOUSE: I’ll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.
CUDDY: Two. I know you’d rather spend a couple of hours listening to yourself than listening to patients. Class starts in twenty minutes. 
BRENDA: Dr. House, there’s a patient.
HOUSE: I’m outta here, take it up with Cuddy.
A voice: Gregg. 
HOUSE: Hi, Stacy.
STACY: How’re you doing?
HOUSE: How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like… you ever see those “Girls Gone Wild” videos?
STACY: Your life’s been like that, or your life’s been spent watching them?  I have missed you.
HOUSE: Is that why you’re here? 
STACY: I need your help. 
HOUSE: Who am I looking at?
STACY: My husband.
HOUSE: Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells. No sign of tumors, no vasculitis. Could be indigestion, or maybe a kidney stone. A little one, can pack a lot of wallop.
STACY: Did you think I wasn’t going to get married?
HOUSE: Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy’s pancreas is pathetic. 
STACY: There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.
HOUSE: Well, maybe there’s nothing to be found.
STACY: Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.
HOUSE: The walks are out. 
STACY: I was around you long enough to know when something’s not right. Mark’s had personality changes, he’s acting strange, disconnected…
HOUSE: Interesting. It means there’s either a neurological component or he’s having an affair.
STACY: No affair, no nothing! He’s sick! I know you’re not too busy; you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I’m asking you a favor.
HOUSE: I’m not too busy, but I’m not sure I want him to live. It’s good seeing you again. 


HOUSE: Three guys walk into a clinic. Their legs hurt. What’s wrong with them?  I’m not going to like you, am I?
KEEN: Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.
HOUSE: Statistically, you’re right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That’s six legs. So, you’ve got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant. 
CARING: What were they doing when pain presented?
HOUSE: I have no idea. 
REBELLIOUS: You didn’t ask? You didn’t take a history?
HOUSE: Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened. Person A, farmer, says he was fixing a fence.  Tightness of the ankle, loss of muscle control.  Person B, volleyball practice.  Coach figured it was a pulled muscle. And C,  we’ve got Carmen Electra. Golfing. 
KEEN: Whoa, you treated the Baywatch chick?
House: The Baywatch thespian. And no, I’ve gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she’s apparently quite the golfer.  Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which?  Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

HOUSE: Did you hike to the fence, and how far?
FARMER: Yes, it’s about half a mile from my farmhouse.
HOUSE: And where’s the pain localized?
FARMER: It started just above my ankle and it’s radiating up.
House: So, what should we do first? 
KEEN: Family history?
House: Indicative of leg pain? That’s a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? 
CARING: Could be a blood issue. We should run a CBC and a D-dimer. 
REBELLIOUS: And get an MRI.
CARING: MRI or a PET scan?
REBELLIOUS: If the problem’s vascular, he’s better off –
HOUSE: Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient’s dead. You killed him. 
KEEN: We had no time to run any tests; there was nothing we could do!
HOUSE: You had time to look at the leg. 

CARING: I thought we were starting with the farmer’s case first.
HOUSE: We are. But if we’re going to look at a leg…

HOUSE: I need you to take off your pants.  Puncture.

CARING: Snakebite.
HOUSE: That would be my guess.
REBELLIOUS: Farmer didn’t know he had been bit by a snake?
HOUSE: That’s what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, never saw a thing.
KEEN: What kind of snake?
HOUSE: You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?
KEEN: How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don’t know what kind of snake it is?
HOUSE: Oh, there are people to find those things out.

CHASE: Shouldn’t we wait for the Humane Society or something?
Foreman: The guy might only have a couple of hours. 

HOUSE: And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?

CAMERON: You have tendonitis.

CARING: How old is this person? I mean, it’s not really a 40-year-old man on a girls’ volleyball team, right?
HOUSE: It’s a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.
CARING: Well, I was just worried that –
HOUSE: Would you worry about her more if she was younger?
KEEN: Obviously we should care about our patients no matter what age –
HOUSE: Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She’s mine, stay away.  Would you operate on your mother?
CARING: Of course not. I’d be too nervous; couldn’t be objective.
HOUSE: Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they’re family? The actual patient is 16. Here’s what happens when doctors care to much.

CAMERON: I need to know everything about you. 

CAMERON: I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson’s, or any other degenerative condition. But there’s this boy at school, and he’s on the boys’ volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won’t call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn’t like her and never did.
HOUSE: You got all this from an examination of the knee?
CAMERON: I think she’s depressed.
HOUSE: She doesn’t have tendoni—
CAMERON: She has tendonitis.
HOUSE: She’s depressed about having tendonitis.
CAMERON: She’s depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.
HOUSE: Not the boy.
CAMERON: No, the boy’s a jerk, she knows that, and yet she’s depressed. I found a nodule.
HOUSE: Ah. Problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.
CAMERON:  I’ll run the tests.

CARING: So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.
HOUSE: No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.


HOUSE: Here’s how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.

CARMEN: Can I put my pants back on now?
HOUSE: I’d rather you didn’t. 
CARING: Which Carmen Electra is this?
HOUSE: First one. The golfer. 
KEEN: Then why isn’t she wearing pants? 
HOUSE:  You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? 
REBELLIOUS: Slipped disc?
HOUSE: Could be. How bad does it hurt?
CARMEN:  It hurts really, really bad.
HOUSE: Yeah?
CARING: It doesn’t seem real. Is she the one faking?
HOUSE: Oh, for God’s sake. She’s here to play out my fantasy, not because she’s Meryl Streep.  Fine. 
LATE 30s MAN: What the hell is wrong with me?  Do something! 
CARING: Too much pain to be a slipped disc. Could be herniated and impinging the nerve root. 
KEEN: Or it could be referred pain from his groin.
HOUSE: Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? 
KEEN: He’s curling; it’s not the back.
HOUSE: Sir, where are you getting pain?
LATE 30s MAN: Help me!
HOUSE: Oooh.
REBELLIOUS: He’s not going to tell us anything if we don’t get him out of pain. Give him 50mg of Demerol.
CARING: We have no history, he could be allergic.
HOUSE:  What do I do?
REBELLIOUS: We can’t diagnose him while he screams.
CARING: Better than killing him with pain killers, then – 
HOUSE: Apparently, he’s not allergic.
LATE 30s MAN: Thank you, I feel a lot better now. 

CARING: We screwed up.
HOUSE: No, you did exactly what his attending did.
REBELLIOUS: And that was the proper way to handle the case?
HOUSE: Yeah.
REBELLIOUS: The guy used him as a dealer!
HOUSE: You’re going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there’s a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm…

CHASE:  Yeah, timber rattlesnake.

CAMERON: Four vials of the CroFab antivenin. Hey, how you doing?
FARMER: All right.
CAMERON:  Thank you. This will start making you feel better really fast.  He’s having an allergic reaction, bag.  Paddles and epi.
NURSE: But his heart’s fine—
CAMERON: It’s not going to stay that way.  Paddles!

HOUSE: What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. 

WILSON: You didn’t think she was going to get married?
HOUSE: She asked me the same question.
WILSON: And… what? You’re not gonna treat him?
HOUSE: There’s probably nothing wrong with him.
Wilson: Oh, sure, that makes sense. She’s just using the old “sick husband” routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she’d be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.
HOUSE: So I should help her because she hates me.
WILSON: She doesn’t hate you. She loves you, she just can’t stand to be around you. 
KEEN: Uh, Dr. House? It’s been almost six minutes.

KEEN: Found him.
HOUSE: The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you’d expect in a case of tendonitis.
REBELLIOUS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don’t really care about the volleyball player.
HOUSE: What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?
REBELLIOUS: Really?
HOUSE: No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It’s not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.
REBELLIOUS: You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.
HOUSE: No, I didn’t. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.

CAMERON: We’re going to start you on Thyroxin. It’ll make you feel better and level your moods.
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Thank you. 

REBELLIOUS: So, that’s it?
HOUSE: You were right the first time. Snakebite guy’s way more interesting. Gross, actually.


FOREMAN: The patient responded to epinephrine and the allergic reaction was arrested. Unfortunately, the patient continues to deteriorate.
CHASE: Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type he caught.
FOREMAN: He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it’s a timber rattlesnake.
HOUSE:  No, it’s not. Notice the volume?
FOREMAN: I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.
HOUSE: 200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There’s no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.

KEEN: We’re supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?
HOUSE: Nope. Unless you’ve got a patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?
CARING: He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.
HOUSE: Or you go online and find there’s only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.
CARING: So we give him the antivenin for the other one.
HOUSE: Is that a question?
KEEN: Well, we can’t just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?
HOUSE: Very good.
KEEN: We’ve gotta find the right snake.
HOUSE: No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.
KEEN: But you said –
CARING: So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.
HOUSE: Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin?  And who goes looking for the snake?
REBELLIOUS: I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.
HOUSe: That’s usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.
CARING: So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.
HOUSE: Yeah.
KEEN: But we can’t be blamed for –
HOUSE: I’m sure this goes against everything you’ve been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don’t know what the right answer is – maybe there’s even no way you could know what the right answer is – doesn’t make your answer right or even okay. It’s much simpler than that. It’s just plain wrong.

HOUSE:  We gave the guy the antivenin.
FARMER: What if I’m allergic again?
FOREMAN: That’s why these people are here. If you have a reaction, we’re ready to do whatever’s necessary to ensure your airway stays open and your heart keeps beating.
FARMER: My wife’s on her way in, can’t this wait?
FOREMAN: I’m sorry, it can’t. [He begins to inject the serum, and nothing happens. House nods, and leaves the room to be confronted by the Late 30s Man.
LATE 30s MAN: It hurts again.

CARING: He came back?
HOUSE:  On average, drug addicts are stupid.
REBELLIOUS: I’d call the cops.
HOUSE: Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn’t risk their careers on a hunch.
REBELLIOUS: It’s not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.
HOUSE: I believe drug addicts get sick. Actually, for some reason they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts. Luckily, you don’t have to play your hunch, there’s a faster way. Actually, there are several. My preference is urine testing.
REBELLIOUS: But you already know he has drugs in his system.
HOUSE: That’s not what I’m testing for.

HOUSE: We’re going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable.
LATE 30s MAN: Shouldn’t I be getting some kind of anesthetic? 
HOUSE: We’re concerned about allergic reactions today.

HOUSE: If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he’s really sick.
REBELLIOUS: Or he’s really jonesing.
HOUSE: There’s easier ways to get a hold of drugs. Other hospitals, for example.  The volleyball player is not responding to treatment.  At least we think it’s not working on account of the fact she’s getting worse. Can you still hear me?
REBELLIOUS: No.
CARING: A little.
KEEN: Not really!
HOUSE:  Well, if you can’t hear me, how do you know what I asked?

CAMERON: I’m sorry. What did I do?
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: I don’t know. It really hurts!
CAMERON: I promise to be very careful.  Susan!

HOUSE: Not her real name!

CAMERON: Susan, I barely touched you! 
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Aaaah! No, it hurts so much!
CAMERON: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I have to get this blood. Just hold on.

CAMERON: Hypersensitivity to touch.
CHASE: Her calcium up?
CAMERON: Lab over 16.
HOUSE: The question is why. Likely suspects?
CHASE: Parathyroid adenoma.
CAMERON: Kidney problems.
FOREMAN: Vit. D intoxification.
CHASE: Hyperthyroid.
FOREMAN: Caused by our treatment?

CARING: Whoa whoa whoa. Can you please slow down? 
HOUSE:  The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH –

HOUSE: -- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that’s enough about the volleyball player. What’s up with the farmer? 
FOREMAN: What farmer?
HOUSE: Snakebite guy. Oh, right, you guys don’t know about him. He doesn’t get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player. Luckily, it’s been well established that time is not a fixed construct.  His condition’s not improving; double the dosage.
FOREMAN: Already did.
HOUSE: There’s another antivenin, it’s not as effective, but –
CHASE: Already tried it.
HOUSE: The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to –
CAMERON: Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing’s working.
HOUSE:  What does it all mean?

CARING: Wrong snake?
HOUSE: We tried every other antivenin we had.
CARING: We’re too late?
HOUSE: Yep. He’s dying. His wife’s here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I’m kidding.
CARING: He’s not dying?
HOUSE: Oh, yeah, he’s dying, but there’s no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the “breaking the news” thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.


HOUSE: The drug addict is peeing blood.

HOUSE: How do they teach you how to tell someone that they’re dying? It’s kind of like teaching architects how to explain why their building fell down. Do you roleplay and stuff?
KEEN: Yeah, one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news.
HOUSE: And what do you have to do to get an A in You’re Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks every time somebody says “Thank you.” Imagine that. This guy’s so good, people thank him for telling them that they’re dying.  Eh, needs brown. I don’t get thanked that often.

HOUSE: You’re dying. In a few hours. There’s nothing we can do except deal with the pain.
FARMER: Well, I need to go home.
HOUSE: You’re not going home.
FARMER: Well, my dog? What will happen to my dog?

CAMERON: Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

REBELLIOUS: Wait, wait, wait. The guy’s dying and all he cares about is his dog?
HOUSE: Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It’s a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they’re dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they’re willing to die for. What they’re willing to lie for.

HOUSE: Well, you must have a neighbor who –
FARMER: The neighbors don’t like him.
HOUSE: Then the Humane Society can take him in and –
FARMER: No, they won’t. Maybe my aunt –
HOUSE: It wasn’t a snakebite, was it?
FARMER: I said I don’t remember being bit.
HOUSE: Sure you do. Just not by a snake. I assume that Cujo bit one of your neighbors awhile back. You tell me that he bit you, and I gotta report it. Cujo’s got a record, he gets the chair. The good news is, you might just live. The bad news is, your dog’s gonna die.

CHASe: The guy risked his life to save this thing?
FOREMAN: I’ll hold him, you swab the mouth.
CHASE: I think I’ve got a better grip here, you go for the mouth.  All right, I’m odds.
FOREMAN: What, are you serious?
CHASE: Come on.
FOREMAN: One, two, three! 
CHASE: I don’t care if he’s scratching your nads off, don’t let go.
FOREMAN: Just do it! 
CHASE: I say we let the guy die.
FOREMAN: I got his head, just do it!

HOUSE: What would you call that? That’s tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs… what’s the differential diagnosis for urine that’s tea-colored?
CARING: Kidney stone.
HOUSE: Kidney stones would cause what?
CARING: Blood in urine.
HOUSE: What color is your pee?
CARING: Yellow.
HOUSE: What color is your blood?
CARING: Red.
HOUSE: What colors did I use?
CARING: Red, yellow and brown.
HOUSE: And brown. What causes brown?
CARING: Wastes.
HOUSE: Which means the kidneys are shutting down. Why?
CARING: Trauma.
HOUSe: None that his history would indicate.
CARING: Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.
HOUSE: Treatment?
CARING: Heat and rest –
HOUSE: Other possible causes.
CARING: Infection.
HOUSE: Start him on antibiotics. What else?  Come on, come on!
CARING: I – I don’t know.
HOUSE: You’re useless. But at least you know it. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?
REBELLIOUS: The trauma diagnosis is right. He takes it easy for a few days, he’ll be fine.
HOUSE: You sure?
REBELLIOUS: The elevated CK rules out infection –
HOUSE: You know what’s worse than useless? Useless and oblivious.  What are they missing?
KEEN: You know, it’s kind of hard to think when you’re in our face like this –
HOUSE: Yeah? You think it’s going to be easier when you’ve got a real patient really dying?  What are you missing?]
CAMERON:  Muscle death.
HOUSE: Not your case.
CAMERON: Nothing wrong with a consult.
CARING: Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It’s toxic to the kidneys.
HOUSE: Brilliant. MRI his leg, see what’s killing it.


REBELLIOUS: Why is the girl getting the MRI?
HOUSE: Because the neck scan revealed nothing and her doctor’s way more obsessive than she thinks she is. 
REBELLIOUS: But you said the guy needed the MRI.
HOUSE: Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death, not one of you said it! Not one of this guy’s doctors said it. They gave him bed rest and antibiotics, just like you guys would have.
CARING: Did he get better?
HOUSE: No.
CARING: Well, how long –
HOUSE: Three days. It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up. You are gonna kill someone. If you can’t handle that reality, pick another profession. Or finish medical school and teach.
CARING: Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?
HOUSE: No, three days before the patient suggested it might have been muscle death.

CAMERON: The MRI revealed an osteosarcoma: a cancerous tumor in your femur. It needs to be removed surgically. With chemo, she has an excellent chance of survival. But I have to warn you, depending on how large the tumor is, and how ingrained it is, the surgeon may need to amputate your leg. I’m sorry.
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER'S MOTHER: It’s okay.

FOREMAN: Well, dogs’ mouths are pretty filthy, but they have natural antibodies to fight off most of the stuff. We don’t. That’s why dog bites can be so nasty. The lab test of your dog’s saliva revealed a type of strep bacteria. It’s commonly known as the “flesh eating disease”. We’ll need to operate immediately to remove the damaged tissue. We may need to remove the leg.

CUDDY: The MRI revealed a problem.
LATE 30s MAN: No kidding.
CUDDY: I’m sorry none of your doctors found it earlier; I’m personally going to oversee your treatment from now on.
LATE 30s MAN: You’re gonna cut me open, aren’t ya?
CUDDY: We may need to remove the leg.

HOUSE: His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn’t caused by the self-injection, wasn’t caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction.
FOREMAN:  God, you were right. It’s House.

CUDDY: We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there’s too much –
HOUSE: I don’t care what you find.
CUDDY: It may become necessary in order to save your life.
HOUSE: I like my leg. I’ve had it for as long as I can remember.
STACY: Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.
HOUSE: They’re not cutting it off.

HOUSE: Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it’s okay to cut a leg off and he’s going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.
REBELLIOUS: Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.
HOUSE: Well, of course they care about their patients. They just care about themselves more. Which is not an unreasonable position. Trying to maximize the tissue you save also maximizes the chances of something going wrong. Which means you’ve gotta be extra careful. Which is such a pain in the ass.

CUDDY: Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.
HOUSE: Yeah, they’re just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation.
CUDDY: Amputation is safer.
HOUSE: For you, or me?
CUDDY: The blockage of blood flow –
HOUSE: Four-day blockage.
CUDDY: Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --
HOUSE: If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system. The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest. On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.
CUDDY: The post-operative pain alone –
HOUSE: I’ll get through it. I understand the risks, you’re in the clear. Go schedule an OR. 
STACY: God, you’re an idiot.
HOUSe: I think I’m more of a jerk.
STACY: I’m not being glib. And I’m not being cute, I don’t want you to kill yourself.
HOUSE: I’m not gonna die.
STACY: Oh, I feel completely reassured.






HOUSE: I think they gotta up that morphine.
STACY: The doctors say they can’t.
HOUSE: The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.
STACY: They screwed up, it doesn’t mean they’re wrong this time.
HOUSE: Sure doesn’t mean they’re right.
STACY: Morphine will kill you.
HOUSE: I can handle it.
STACY: You’re in pain, you’re not thinking right.
HOUSE: That’s why I need the damn morphine!
STACY: Okay, I’ll talk to them. 

STACY: Oh my God, how much longer is the pain going to last?
CUDDY: It depends on how much muscle cell death there was. He could be right, he could come out of this with almost full use of his leg.
STACY: Or?
CUDDY: He could be in pain for the rest of his life. There’s a third option, surgically. A middle ground between what we did and amputation.
STACY: He’s not big on middle ground.
CUDDY: Yeah.

HOUSE: Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.
NURSE: You just had 5 mLs.
HOUSE: The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.
NURSE: I’ll talk to your doctor.
HOUSE: Well, you better make it fast, ‘cause I’m about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.
NURSE: I could get in trouble –
HOUSE: Listen, it’s not a narcotic! I’m not looking for a buzz. You’ve got about twenty seconds.  I was wrong. 
SOMEONE: What have you got?
NURSE: Wide complex tachycardia.
CUDDY: Who diagnosed –
NURSE: He did.
CUDDY: Paddles! Charge.
NURSE: Clear! 

HOUSE: The patient was technically dead for over a minute.



CUDDY: He’s back.

WILSON:  Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?
HOUSE: Define real. They were real experiences. What they meant… Personally, I choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see visions, this patient saw. They’re all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down.
FOREMAN: You choose to believe that?
HOUSE: There’s no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.
CAMERON: You find it more comforting to believe that this is it?
HOUSE: I find it more comforting to believe that this isn’t simply a test.

STACY: How bad is the pain right now?
HOUSE: It’s bad.
STACY: It’s not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You’d be getting better.
HOUSE: It’s just taking longer.
STACY: No, it’s not. We’ve got to let him cut the leg off.
HOUSE: It’s my leg. It’s my life.
STACY: Would you give up your leg to save my life?
HOUSE: Of course I would.
STACY: Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?
HOUSE: I would say it’s their choice.
STACY: Wha – not a chance! You’d browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You’d shove it in their face that it’s just a damn leg! You don’t think you deserve to live? You don’t think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? 
HOUSE: I can’t, I can’t, I’m sorry.
STACY: The pain alone is going to kill you.
HOUSE: I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor.

CUDDY: He change his mind?
STACY: No. He’s asked to be put in a chemically induced coma so he can sleep through the worst part of the pain.
CUDDY: We can do that.
STACY: What happens after he’s in the coma?
CUDDY: We’ll obviously monitor his condition closely, and if he can get through the next forty-eight hours without another cardiac incident –
STACY: I meant, I’m his health-care proxy, I get to make medical decisions for him if he’s not able to.
CUDDY: You should talk to him about what he wants to do.
STACY: I know what he wants, but if he’s out it’s my call, right? 

CUDDY: You’ll be out in less than a minute.
HOUSE: Thank you.  Hey.
STACY: Hey.
HOUSe: I’ll see you when I wake up. We’ll go golfing. I love you.
STACY: I love you, too. I’m sorry.
HOUSE:  You’ve got nothing to be sorry about. 
STACY: The middle ground you were talking about?
CUDDY: We go in, take out the dead muscle. There’s still some risk of reperfusion injury, but –
STACY: Give me the forms you need signed.
CUDDY: You’re saving his life.
STACY: He won’t see it that way.

HOUSE: Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the patient’s leg was severely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, patient continues to experience chronic pain.
CARING: She had no right to do that.
REBELLIOUS: She had the proxy.
CARING: She knew he didn’t want the surgery.
REBELLIOUS: She saved his life!
KEEN: Well, we don’t know that. Maybe he would have been fine –
CARING: It doesn’t matter. It’s the patient’s call.
REBELLIOUS: The patient’s an idiot.
HOUSE:  They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?
CUDDY:  Twenty minutes ago.
HOUSE: I’m not doing this again.  And this guy is not the world’s greatest dad. Not even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That’s why he’s always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. 

HOUSE: Stacy, it’s Gregg. I’ve got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn’t late. "

Because Of You,kelly clarkson,2005,2000,"Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Ain't No Way To Treat A Lady,helen reddy,1975,1970,"I guess it was yourself you were involved with
I would have sworn it was me
I might have found out sooner
If you'd only let me close enough to see
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
I was only being a picture
With all the colors I know
While you were busy looking
Into wide blue mirrors and loving the show
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
There's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane
And I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain
You see the time you never felt me loving you or needing you
So leaving you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain
I was looking out for my happiness
While you were looking within
And before you know your own reflection
Always starts to tire you and it's happened again
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way

I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooh, we got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch

Not come and go in a heated rush

Cooler Than Me,mike posner,2010,2010,"If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?

Now don't you dare act like you don't know (don't know)
Know what's up (Know what's up) cause your nose is up
I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior(Dior)
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup

Cause it sure seems you got no doubts

Achy Breaky Heart,billy ray cyrus,1992,1990,"You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh


Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh

Sexual Healing,marvin gaye,1982,1980,"Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight

Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby
Ohhh

Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight

I need sexual healing
Oh when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling
'Cause I'm all alone

An Everlasting Love,andy gibb,1978,1970,"I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold
Give me what I've hungered for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die"
Smoke On The Water,deep purple,1973,1970,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water


We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water"
Rock And Roll Music,the beach boys,1976,1970,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony


I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane


Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Outro
Say, if you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that
If you wanna dance with me"
America,neil diamond,1981,1980,"Far
We've been traveling far
Without a home
But not without a star
Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream
On the boats and on the planes
They're coming to America
Never looking back again
They're coming to America
Home, don't it seem so far away
Oh, we're traveling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and we'll say our grace
Freedom's light burning warm
Freedom's light burning warm
Everywhere around the world
They're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled
They're coming to America
Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
Today, today, today, today, today
My country 'tis of thee
Today
Sweet land of liberty
Today
Of thee I sing
Today
Of thee I sing

Only One You,t.g. sheppard,1982,1980,"I've seen this world
From corner to corner
There ain't much ground
That I haven't covered
I've drank its wine
I've tasted its pleasures
I've known some love
And I've known some lovers
If there's one lesson
In the livin' I've done
The best things only come
Along in numbers of one
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
I've been a king
And I've been a pauper
And everything there is in between
It took some time
To know what is timeless
But I've found and
Learned what that means
I'll never leave you, girl
'Cause I know the catch
The wonders of this world
Will never come with a match
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you

Picture Postcards From L.A.,joshua kadison,1994,1990,"I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A
When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
And I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say
I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, ""Next week, I'm gonna go.""
She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay
And still no picture postcards from L.A
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?
I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me

I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe

Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me



It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure"

For a second straight record for them fools disrespectin

And being the Tripp Locc, I just can't take it no more

MTV, the Box, BET it's still hits
24-7 eastsidein' it, G ridin
We slidin, bomb to the fullest, fuck hidin' it
You know what's up wit' me the dollar bill and my steal
I play for keeps, that's on the real

Now get the glass and the yak and take a step back
And try to figure out this nigga Wayniac, the maniac

It's like this, or should I say it's like that (like that)
I got that knack to make the beats smack
From my nine-millimeter microphone Mack

We just doin' our thang, straight up, it's fixin' to hit the fan
Serious like that cuz some ain't goin understand
Anticipation got'em all on the sack
All my time that I gotta spin up that track
Money got me motivated, word up to my moms
Nine-four set it up so now it's time for the bomb
To get dropped, non-stop on my way to the T-O-P
Servin' conversation, as if it were some cavi

You could tell I was a hustla from the start
Which meant the Locc and me could never ever see a mark
Cuz sippin-ass niggas wear them pumps to get fed
Bitches steady gankin' while they puffin' up your head
Since I'm the Loc they come and show we just chillin
Peepin out my whole click I'm wit make a killin
You know me I'm the one that will always make'em pay
But for now I'ma slide and listen to the women as they say

Catch a grip young Tripp, that's what they told me
I gotta thank god for all my true homies
You molded me, into a true G
That's how I put it down (That's right) with Tripnology
And dissocology from G to G
Helps a nigga like me see clearly
I'm tellin' you the truth with proof
It's like a pimp tryin to pimp some hoes with no coupe

Carved in the bark with an arrow through it

Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

It's hard to bury the hatchet

Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you

That you would love me for the rest of your life

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

Talk Show Shhh!,shae jones,1999,1990,"Who da hell you think you messin' wit
Tryin' to play me like a fool
I overheard a conversation
Between your ex-girlfriend and you
Then I saw it so clearly
Suddenly it all made since
Before you go on explaining yourself
Let me explain my evidence

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I felt like you was hiding something
When you started showering alone
And someone used my Chanel perfume
Since this moment when I left home
You tiptoeing in the bedroom
While your thinking i'm asleep
If I catch your ass in one more lie
I'll be telling you to leave

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

He say, she say
You got our business all up in the streets cheatin'
He say, she say
Everyone knows us like we're on t.v

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

Arc Of A Diver,steve winwood,1981,1980,"She bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman
This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo

Lean streaky music
Spawned on the streets
I hear it but with you
I had to go
'Cause my rock 'n' roll
Is putting on weight
And the beat it goes on
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
With you my love
We're going to raid the future
With you my love
We're going to stick up the past
We'll hold today to ransom

Is a map of the world

And everything around her is a silver pool of light
The people who surround her feel the benefit of it
It makes you calm
She holds you, captivated in her palm

She likes to leave you hanging on her word

One Of These Days,tim mcgraw,1998,1990,"We used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away

And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love me"

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick

Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me, dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
And I just want to blow your mind

But, back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bouswar
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards

Take the game international

Man on the TV's gone insane, everybody's just laughing
People 'cross the world holding on
The earth caved in, the ocean came down crashing
My neighbor lost his house cause he can't find a job
Don't you dare pledge allegiance, don't you dare speak of God
Speak of God
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Now I'm begging for forgiveness
I wanna make a difference even in the smallest way
I'm only one person, but I can feel it working
I believe in better days
That's why I pray
Some stupid video posted as a joke, somebody's life gets ruined
Out of everything we can create
Where is the cure to keep the sick from losing
Babies having babies cause their parents are always gone
Somehow we have forgotten how to make a house a home
How to make a house a home
Oh! Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm begging for forgiveness, I wanna make a difference
Even in the smallest way
I'm only one person, but I can feel it working
I believe in better days
That's why I pray, yeah
That's why I pray, yeah
These demons from my past haunt me every night
And I just can't get through it
If I could forget them on my own, I'll let go and just move on
But heaven knows I am only human
And that's why I pray, yeah yeah
That's why I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
Yes I'm begging for forgiveness
I just wanna make a difference
I believe in better days
That's why I pray"

Someone To Love Me For Me,lisa lisa ,1988,1980,"Oh

End of another long show
And I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave
Because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screamed out
""No, just let dreams be your master""
Look past my fame. I'm in need
Need of some laughter

Oh, please let me live in your world
I hope that your eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me
Mmm
Me

So you ask yourself
Oh, this feeling
Is it true from the heart?
Was it my fame and glory?
Why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
And if I want satisfaction
I can have anyone that I see
But why should I settle for less
When I need you
To love me for me
Oh, so confused
Is this real?
Do you love me?
Give me the feeling you care endlessly
My love

Please let me live in your world
(Oh)
I hope that your eyes can see
(Hope that your eyes can see)
That I need someone

To love me

Please let me live in your world
Hey, Paul Anthony
Why don't you say something to all the lovers out there?
Well, Bow-Legged Lou
I was just about to ask you to drop the same science
Well, I got a better idea
Hey, Lisa
Why don't you tell it like you feel it?
Well, I would like to say
To all the lovers of the world
If you are in love with someone
I mean really in love with someone
Make sure that you hold on to that person
Make sure that person
Loves you for who you are
And not for the materialistic things that surround you
Enough said
For me
That I need someone
(Yeah, yeah)
To love me for me"
One More Try,kristine w,1996,1990,"(verse 1)
Every window in my hometown is empty
And I really don't know why
And the house you used to live in
Is cold and falling down
And I am tired and I'm weary
And Lord those gray skies bring me down
And I came home for just one reason
To find myself in this quiet town (yeah)
And I'm thinking. .

Oh I'm thinking time's been my teacher
I don't want to leave you

It all seems so long ago
I thought the world turned around without me baby
But I just didn't know oh
That I was wrong to go and leave you
To go and leave your world behind
But now time has been my teacher
And now I finally found

She Don't Love You,eric paslay,2015,2010,"She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rolled away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way, oh
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rolled away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

She don't love you
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
I remember her in the sunlight
I remember her when she was mine, mine"
A Good Day To Run,darryl worley,2001,2000,"I'm tired of working every day for a dollar
About to choke on my own blue collar
This ain't gonna last
Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion
I can't make a move too fast
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run
My baby's been working as a cashier
She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song
There're some places that we ain't been
Some things we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run"
Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On,neal mccoy,2005,2000,"Awww Yah!
Billys at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!
She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!
Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Cause life looks good, good, good
So good, good, good
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles ... on"
Cherokee,europe,1988,1980,"They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change
Made them realize, that the promises were lies

The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn
x2
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies

So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

(yeah)

Oh oh oh

Angel,lionel richie,2001,2000,"I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart

You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight...

Life is just a moment, we're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us if we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When there's darkness all around me, you're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind

You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle

Precious Declaration,collective soul,1997,1990,"Hitched a ride to the peaceful side of town
Then proceeded where thieves were no longer found
Can't crash now I've been waiting for this
Won't crash now I found some encouragement
Precious declaration reads
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
New meanings to the words I feed upon
Wake within my veins elements of freedom
Can't break now I've been living for this
Won't break now I'm cleansed with hopefulness
Precious declaration says
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
Once I jumped thru hoops of fire
High and far as you required
I was blind but now I see
Salvation has discovered me"
Ooohhhwee,master p ,2002,2000,"To the beat y'all

Weebie! Holla at me (c'mon), I'm at the ball

The way she make it twurk and grab the wall - OOOHHHWEE!
Oh, baby you know whatchu doin - OOOHHHWEE!
No Limit got the steps bouncin and movin - OOOHHHWEE!

I know a big girl, with a ironed skirt
Give her couple dollars, she'll make it work
I mean holla at me whoadie, you know our crew large
My fantasy's to have sex wit two broads
On a boat or a plane, some exotic cars
From a Bentley to a Lex, girl, bring the toys
On the dance floor, shawty started takin it off
Took her to the V.I.P., started breakin me off
Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists
I told her ""Wait, it don't stop, keep drinkin the Cris'""
I'm a country boy just like the Dukes of Hazzard
See a fine chick, you know I'm gon' grab her
Annie May girl where you at?
This No Limit boy tryin to do that thang
I said ""Rock the boat, don't let it sank""
It's time to go to war, I got the tank

 Say that then

I could work, put ya body, c'mon back it up, back it up
You know Weebie and Master P, we gon' tank it up, tank it up
Turn around to the ground, you know how it goes
Catch the flow, tippie-toe, come and wobble some mo'
Like you know how I do it so don't act surprised
For a fact gotchu dancin 'til you hurtin your thighs
Now won'tcha tune it up and wobble wit it
Act a fool and wobble wit it
Won'tcha make it hustle, ooh baby don't pull a muscle
Gotcha workin on the wall 'til you run outta breath
No Limit like I told ya so y'all give us respect
Now you could shake it like a dog, break my fuckin balls
Do it how ya do it, lemme see ya take it off


Now won'tcha rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on
Rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock
Now won'tcha turn around and hustle wit it
Back it up and hustle wit it, test around and hustle wit it
Ooh baby, ooh baby

Mary had a big ol' butt, in them tight ass jeans it'd show
And every club that Mary was at them thugs were sure to go
I mean she had bow-legs wit the curves just like a bottle
Project chick but pretty just like a model
When I'm rollin through the hood she on dubs
Don't mind gettin in and shakin her thang in the club
I mean, beat bopper she loved the tote shoppers
Call her head nurse then I'mma be the doctor
A real country mamma cook grits and eggs
And she won't leave the farm except to get paid
Candies on twat cause she love to ball
Find her at the mizzle on the dresser or the mall
Buyin, high heels on some leather boots
Or lookin for them ballers wit the crazy loot, WHAT?!



Where them No Limit boys at? Throw them 'bows

Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothin' but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost

She Was,mark chesnutt,2002,2000,"She started her new life ten dollars in debt
That's all it took to get started back then
A trip to the courthouse across the state line
No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind
He was eighteen, she wasn't
But she said she was and never thought twice
Came back home as my daddy's wife
She just shook her head when her momma said
""Are you sure he's the one?"" She was
He took a job and farmed on the side
He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied
Changes were coming to their little world
She said ""What would you like, a boy or a girl?""
He said ""Are you?""
She said she was and never thought twice
'Bout takin the next step in building their lives
Soon there were three and she tried to be
Everything to us And she was
Those precious moments turned into years
In what seemed like the blink of an eye
I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her
""Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?""
She said she was but she thought twice
Holdin' my hand as she let go of life
Daddy always said a woman like her
Would be hard to give up
And she was
She was
If there ever was a picture of love
She was"
Only When I Lose Myself,depeche mode,1998,1990,"It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotised, I feel paralysed
I have found heaven

There's a thousand reasons why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
To keep me hanging on feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied, I belong inside
Your velvet heaven

Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this?
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss?
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
Before I could even start to understand?

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself"

That's Just Jessie,kevin denney,2002,2000,"Sometimes in the morning
My coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes
Before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work
Every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been
And in a crowded elevator
I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting
Looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies
And I can't help but laugh
That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those ""kiss me"" green eyes smilin' back at me
That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
An sometimes in the evening
I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the sent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again
That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And thos ""kiss me"" green eyes smilin' back at me

A Guy Walks Into A Bar,tyler farr,2015,2010,"The joke's on me and it ain't funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T, believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes...

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

One More Day,new edition,1997,1990,"Yeah, I can't deny it
On the inside, I'm slowly dying
But with a little love, it'll be alright
Just give me one more day
I promise I'll make it up to you
I never meant to hurt you, baby
Just trust me, listen

I can't deny it, that you got me crying, you see
And I'm, I'm slowly dying, so we can't give up trying to be
With a little love, it will be all right
With a little kiss, let me hold you tight
With a little peace, it could be fine
And baby, don't you leave me tonight

I just need one more day, and I won't make you cry
Darling believe, and baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart, and I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day, and loving me will be fine

People tell me that true love is blind
But I'm trying to prove that true love is kind
All that I want is to make things right
So won't you be my baby tonight

I just need one more day, and I won't make you cry
Darling believe, and baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart, and I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day, and loving me will be fine

One more day (one more day, one more day)
One more day (one more day, one more day)
One more day (one more day, one more day)
One more day (one more day, one more day)

Take The L.,the motels,1982,1980,"Watching my head, holding my face
One more evening gone to waste
No longer do I know my place
Killing time and missing my cues
Watching her belong to you
Tears could only change my view
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x2)
Growing up has always been tough
Good intentions never good enough
I would take you far away
Do anything to make you stay
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x3)
Every drink and ciggarette
All those hands we never met
There are things we should forget
Now its over
Over
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x3)

Take the L out of lover and it's over (until fade)"

Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low

Make your ass touch the floor till your legs is broke
Take that big ol' booty girl and scrub the ground
You can do it up and down and round and round
As long as that pussy ain't stiff
Dance and make all the niggas look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin hell
I remember Magic City before the Freaknik
Before the police went on all them weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose with it
All them skinny hoes, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Let a nigga fuck tonight
Damn right bitch, fuck my wife
You my slut for life
You know all I do, is count that cash

Biaatch....Biaatch....Shake that Monkey

I bet she can't wiggle like with a dick in her
Have a motor booty contest and pick a winner
When she runnin', you never see a ho come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor

Out here we can let it go, yeah
Just me and my good friends, jug of wine, lil' sip
Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

The July sky, so high moon shining by the river side
Stealing hearts and running wild
In our own little world, Tennessee boys and girls running free
Out here it's good times for miles
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you want to do, what's it going to be
We can get a wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your back's sticking to the seat
We can sneak off to beat the heat
I'll be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer

Shuttin' Detroit Down,john rich,2009,2000,"My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news
About how they're losing billions
And it's up to me and you to come running to the rescue
Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear
Cause they're selling make-believe
And we don't buy that here

Cause in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down

Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cause he ain't the one to blame
When I look down to see his calloused hands
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad

Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town

Stopped in my tracks again
Closer then I've been to where I wanna be
A broken heart standing in my way
Big as life on a real bad day
Making lemons into lemonade
Ain't nothing new to me No
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
Now looking back I realize
How hard it is to recognize
Opportunity in disguise
That's some Calamity
So I ain't gonna cuss my luck
Every time a door slams shut
I know a window's gonna open up
Just as long as I believe
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)

Changing Faces

How we do
Yo, all of my rhymes for all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Kill the late nights cruisin'
All you see is the brake lights, and hair blowin'
You know where we goin'
Or at the club in the rear frontin', poppin', droppin'
The amount some cats will wear, ain't trying to hear nothin'
Probably was wilder than Bobby, are you the Whitney to get me Hold me down and make me slow down the V-twizzy?
Keep the ice out the club lights change faces
Get I love wifey on the license plate
Wait, make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down
Cop you some sprinkles the hound with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep you jiggy all of my days, uh huh

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' 'bout you babe
Got me dreamin' 'bout you baby

All that I have

Loving me

Now we going house shoppin'
Everybody wanna know the price your spouse droppin'
Keep that on the low R. Kelly style, it's quite shockin'
A year ago, all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockings
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle, rice droppin'
Got you a nice rock and...
Now it's on and poppin', droppin' hotter than platinum bracelets

Taxi Dancing,rick springfield ,1985,1980,"I think that it's high time we had a talk
I think that we're making a big mistake
I've been feeling lately the magic is gone
Are we just together for convenience sake, baby
I don't believe it (feeling), I don't think that's true (tied down)
It'll just pass (need to) if we allow it to (break free)
It's just a stage (they say) we're going through (clean cuts)
I think you're just restless (heal much) for something new (faster)
Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return is a peace of each other's time
Are we just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're playing for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation
Don't know if you're right, don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long
Don't make it hard (I won't), don't make it easy (hold you)
We'll just walk away (if you) at the end of the song (must go)
Baby, put one last nickel in the juke box
Give that love we once felt just one final spin around
'Cause we're just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
And we're just dancing
(Solo)
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're paying for me and I'm paying for you

Sour Times (Nobody Loves Me),portishead,1995,1990,"(Originally by Portishead)
To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday
Oh these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
After time the bitter taste
Of innocence, decent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide ....
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you
Nobody loves.. me
It's true
Not, like, you.. do"
Best Of Times,peter cetera,1988,1980,"Things get bad, times get tough
Everybody knows
You gotta be a little stronger
Just to have the things you need
Everybody knows
If you try a little harder
You're gonna live a whole lot longer
Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour
Going out and stayin' far too long
You got to believe in something
When you believe in something
These are the best of times
You got to have faith in someone
When you have faith in someone
These are the best of times
Don't give up, can't give in
Never lose a minute
It's a long hard road back from nowhere
Love is not what you take out
It's what you put back in it
Take you chance, there's no doubt
Everything will all work out
See my way, I know where I'm goin'
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up
I want it all as soon as I can
Right where I am
You got to believe in something
When you believe in something

You got to have faith in someone
When you have faith in someone
These are the best of times"

I cried so hard when she left me
I just rolled up in a great big ball
All my life drained from my body
'Cause that one tear
That one tear just wouldn't fall
How I tried to forget her
But this one tear won't set me free
I didn't know till she went away
Just how much that woman meant to me
Ooh yes, she did
Without her my life is nothing
Even though she let me down
If my baby don't come home to me
In this one tear
In this one tear I'm gonna drown
Every night I, I say a prayer
And I whisper something, Lord
I've got to get my baby back
So this one tear
So this one tear will let me go
You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me
You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me"

I love to feel the rain on my face

'Til the pain hits my side
As if I run fast enough
I can leave all the pain and the sadness behind

I love to feel the rain on my face

I love to feel the rain on my face

Someone,el debarge,1987,1980,"Someone just like me
Running into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come
Somehow found my someone

Close to you
That's how I feel
When the world's asleep
And we're sharing sweet
Solitude
Almost gave up
Trying to find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Still can't believe it
What were the odds of


Was that me?
Not long ago
No one here to care
No one's dreams to share
You agree
Nights can be rough
When you can't find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Hard to believe it
What were the odds of


You and me
All alone
That's my favorite time of night

And on my screens than Vanna White
How should I roll when I write?
Then light the spliff, now it's time to recite

Anchorage,michelle shocked,1989,1980,"Well, Michelle Shocked, I am actually totally shocked. What the hell? It's freaky to me, the whole business of going from a queer icon to someone who would actually say that God hates us. When the shock wore off, I found that people were super angry, but I just got scared. I think that as a queer person of color, I have been scared my entire life. I get over it bit by bit, enough to get by and live, but then something like this happens, and it's like getting gay bashed all over again.
When people say that God hates fags, there's this idea that it's OK to kill us, that it doesn't matter if we die, because if God -- the supposedly loving force in the world, the one who is supposed to love everyone and everything, the one, the only, whatever, whenever -- hates us, then how are we to exist? But if he hates us, why did he make so many of us?
When someone like Michelle Shocked, formerly a beloved, alt queer muse and maker of the '90s, decides that it is OK to hate us and lets us know that God does too, I am truly sickened, as she of all people should know what this means.
I made many mixtapes with that song ""Anchorage,"" which I always regarded as a lesbian anthem. It was the song playing on the eight-track cassette converter in the big, old, gas-guzzling behemoth of a Buick that I used to peel out of a dirt parking lot behind a country roadhouse, with tall corn and grass on all sides, to get away from a scary dude who had suddenly appeared out of the dark shadows of the cornfield, wielding nunchucks -- or it might have been a belt with a heavy buckle, or maybe a tire iron. Fear clouds my memory, because when you are just a teenager and are being chased in the middle of the night by a crazy man calling you and your girlfriend ""fucking dykes"" while whipping something around, knocking the ""ick"" off the ""Buick"" on the back of your car, it's hard to pay attention to precisely what is in his hands, because you are not looking at him; you are looking to get away. I didn't turn back; I kept going, maybe to keep this girl safe (I might be butch after all), but probably because I was too scared to turn back.
If you ever are terrorized like this, run. Don't look back. Don't be a hero. It's not like the movies. Just get out of there. Hatred and homophobia can never be underestimated. And the effect of someone saying ""God hates fags"" can never be underestimated either. It's a license to kill. It's a death sentence. It's not funny. It's not OK. It's not something I can let go easily, because I know what it truly means.
The violence and hopelessness behind the statement keeps me up at night and will haunt me just like the tragic memory of a young gay man who was murdered in front of my family's bookstore in the '70s. He was beaten to death because some men (who were never caught, let alone punished) believed that God hated him. In my nightmares I find his teeth all over the ground, and I try to save them, and they keep falling out of my hands and pockets, and then I realize that he is dead and has no use for them anymore, and I wake up sweating, my screams waking everyone in the house."
A Heart In New York,art garfunkel,1981,1980,"New York
To that tall skyline I come
Flyin' in from London
To your door
New York
Lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark
New York
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
There's a heart
A heart that lives in New York
A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, the love in her eyes
An open door and a friend for the night
New York
You've got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's worth of difference
So here's to you New York"
Stranger,stephen stills,1984,1980,"When I look
And my eyes finally meet a lady
Who has something unique
I must know her
Don't stumble on my feet
Get together
At least just enough to speak
To this stranger
If I dream, I'm bound to lose my place
Fascinated, with this beautiful face
Watching her eyes
There focusin' on me
Pay attention, she is talking to me
I'm the stranger
Tryin' to remember that getting it wrong
Is what everyone does
Mutual attraction can be so
Distracting, forget where you were
Strangers can fall in love
When you think about love at all
And you wind up cryin' the blues
And the lonelies person that you know
Is starin' out of the mirror at you you you
Are the stranger
And you know the danger
It'll be right
And you know that she's
With you
She ain't thinkin'
About what she's supposed to do
Worry'in
Might as well just be pretendin'
Hurryin'
When you know every new
Friend is a stranger"

A.D.I.D.A.S.,killer mike ,2003,2000,"All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Marion Barry calls for crack or like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it


Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' Cuban coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra
Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow


When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom"

Guess the iPhone autocorrected
And he thought I said ""now it's time for a Dedication.""

So now y'all got a twenty pack
What's your address?
You're welcome
And not your email address neither
D6: Reloaded
Front door, leggo
A Dedication!

Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop-bop, but if I was blind, all I hear is runnin'
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbin'
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it comin'
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speakin' hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth, and mug you
The pockets bustin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleedin' blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga, triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace, but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the streets, I gotta hit a hustle
Every day of the week I gotta get loaded-loaded, skip the bufferin'
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches sufferin' 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fuckin'
They can't hide their battle scars but they can hide their stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how their mouths are runnin'
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall, but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown, or nothing; I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin', we got babies smugglin' in their Huggies
Niggas jugglin' different kind of drugs, Feds strugglin'
Sippin' Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it head-buttin'
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard and shred somethin'
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin
Go 'head, dump 'em, redrum 'em

Welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her"

We can build a wall of protection.'

All I Have To Do Is Dream,andy gibb ,1981,1980,"Dear Gwyneth,
I really enjoyed your recent comments to E! about how easy an office job is for parents, compared to the grueling circumstances of being on a movie set. “I think it’s different when you have an office job, because it’s routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening,” you said. “When you’re shooting a movie, they’re like, ‘We need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,’ and then you work 14 hours a day, and that part of it is very difficult. I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it’s not like being on set.”
As a mother of a toddler, I couldn’t agree more!
“Thank God I don’t make millions filming one movie per year” is what I say to myself pretty much every morning as I wait on a windy Metro-North platform, about to begin my 45-minute commute into the city. Whenever things get rough, all I have to do is keep reminding myself of that fact. It is my mantra.
And I know all my fellow working-mom friends feel the same. Am I right, ladies?
We’re always gabbing about how easy it is to balance work and home life. Whenever I meet with them at one of our weekly get-togethers — a breeze to schedule, because reliable baby sitters often roam my neighborhood in packs, holding up signs peddling their services — we have a competition to see who has it easier. Is it the female breadwinners who work around the clock to make sure their mortgages get paid, lying awake at night, wracked with anxiety over the idea of losing their jobs? Or is it the mothers who get mommy-tracked and denied promotions? What about the moms with “regular” 9-to-5 jobs, who are penalized when their kids are sick and they don’t have backup child care?
Those women are living the dream, I tell you!
Which reminds me, child care. As you know, Gwynnie, having a staff can be a real drag. It’s so hard to find good help these days! That’s why it’s a good thing there’s all this nationally subsidized, high-quality day care lying around for the taking. It just makes things easier knowing you have such a strong support network and don’t have to pay someone anywhere from $30K to $65K annually to take care of your child full-time.
You mentioned in your E! interview that when someone has an office job, “You know you can do all the stuff in the morning,” and that hit the nail on the head. As someone with an office job, my mornings are obviously pretty leisurely. Sometimes I even have time to drink half of my coffee before it gets cold! After my 6 a.m. wake-up, I have a lot of time to loll around, hopping in the shower and then throwing makeup on my face, hoping that I’ll have enough time to put my tights on before my son starts crying in his crib. Then, when he does start crying, I have to make the decision: Do I get fully dressed, or do I go tend to him with my hair still dripping wet? Talk about being spoilt for choice!
Then I have a few Bellinis and adjust my 401(k) contributions.
After I get home from work, I’m full of energy and ready to cook dinner using one of the recipes you post on your lifestyle Web site, Goop: slow-cooked kale, pancetta and bread crumbs, anyone? After that, I’ll go to yoga, spend a few hours meditating and maybe do some online shopping, picking up a pair of $350 white leopard-printed short-shorts via Goop in preparation for the “spring break” I’ll take with my husband and son.
If there’s one thing I look good in after having a child, it’s short-shorts.
So, Gwyneth, you’ve figured out the secret of working parents everywhere: Livin’ la vida desk job is a breeze compared to the 14-hour days of a film set. Fourteen hours? Who in New York — especially those in the finance, law and tech professions — could possibly work 14 whole hours?
Luckily, those 9-to-5 “ordinary job” hours grow on trees here.
And if you lose one, all you have to do is find another.
Yours,
Mackenzie"

Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know
This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right
But I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down

Call your name every day

Celebration/Take Your Chance,fun factory,1996,1990,"Setting
The dining room of a fairly large suburban house, belonging to a prosperous manufacturer. It has good solid furniture of the period. The general effect is substantial and heavily comfortable, but not cosy and homelike. (If a realistic set is used, then it should be swung back, as it was in the production at the New Theatre. By doing this, you can have the dining-table centre downstage during Act One, when it is needed there, and then, swinging back, can reveal the fireplace for Act Two, and then for Act Three can show a small table with telephone on it, downstage of fireplace.. By this time the dining-table and its chairs have moved well upstage. Producers who wish to avoid this tricky business, which involves two re-settings of the scene and some very accurate adjustments of the extra flats necessary would be well advised to dispense of an ordinary realistic set, if only because the dining table becomes a nuisance. The lighting should be pink and intimate until the INSPECTOR arrives, and then it should be brighter and harder.)
At rise of curtain, the four BIRLINGS and GERALD are seated at the table, with ARTHUR BIRLING at one end, his wife at the other, ERIC downstage, and SHEILA and GERALD seated upstage. EDNA, the parlourmaid, is just clearing the table, which has no cloth, of dessert plates and champagne glasses, etc., and replacing them with decanter of port, cigar box and cigarettes. Port glasses are already on the table. All five are in the evening dress of the period, the men in tails and white ties, not dinner jackets. ARTHUR BIRLING is a heavy looking, rather portentous looking man in his middle fifties but rather provincial in his speech. His wife is about fifty, a rather cold woman and her husband's social superior. SHEILA is a pretty girl in her early twenties, very pleased with life and rather excited. GERALD CROFT is an attractive chap about thirty, rather too manly to be a dandy but very much the easy well-bred man about town. ERIC is in his early twenties, not quite at ease, half shy, half assertive. At the moment they have all had a good dinner, are celebrating a special occasion, and are pleased with themselves.
Act One
Arthur Birling: Giving us the port, Edna? That’s right. ( he pushes it towards Eric..) you ought to like this port, Gerald, as a matter of fact, Finchley told me it's exactly the same port your father gets from him. 
 
Gerald: Then it'll be all right. The governor prides himself on being a good judge of port. I don’t pretend to know much about it. 
 
Sheila: (gaily, possessively) I should jolly well think not, Gerald, I'd hate you to know all about port – like one of these purple-faced old men.  
 
Arthur Birling: here , I’m not a purple-faced old man. 
 
Sheila Birling: no, not yet. But then you don't know all about port – do you? 
 
Birling: (noticing that his wife has not taken any) Now then, Sybil, you must a take a little tonight. Special occasion, y'know, eh? 
 
Sheila: Yes, go on, mummy. You must drink our health. 
 
Mrs Birling : (smiling) Very well, then. Just a little, thank you.(to Edna, who is about to go, with tray.) all right, Edna. I'll ring from the drawing room when we want coffee. Probably in about half an hour.
 
Edna: (going) Yes, ma'am.
 
Edna goes out. They now have all the glasses filled. Birling beams at them and clearly relaxes.
 
Birling: Well, well – this is very nice. Very nice. Good dinner too, Sybil. Tell cook from me.
 
Gerald: (politely) Absolutely first class.
 
Mrs Birling: (reproachfully) Arthur, you're not supposed to say such things-
 
Birling: Oh – come come – I’m treating Gerald like one of the family. And I'm sure he won't object.
 
Sheila: (with mocking aggressiveness) Go on, Gerald – just you object!
 
Gerald: (smiling) Wouldn't dream of it. In fact, I insist upon being one of the family now. I've been trying long enough, haven't I? (as she does not reply, with more insistence.) Haven't I? You know I have.
 
Mrs Birling: (smiling) Of course she does.
 
Sheila: (half serious, half playful) Yes – except for all last summer, when you never came near me, and I wondered what had happened to you.
 
Gerald: And I’ve told you – I was awfully busy at the works all that time.
 
Sheila: (same tone as before) Yes,that's what you say.
 
Mrs Birling: Now, Sheila, don't tease him. When you're married you'll realize that men with important work to do sometimes have to spend nearly all their time and energy on their business. You'll have to get used to that, just as I had.
 
Sheila: I don't believe I will. (half playful, half serious, to Gerald.) So you be careful.
 
Gerald: Oh – I will, I will.
 
 Eric suddenly guffaws. His parents look at him. 
 
Sheila: (severely) Now – what's the joke?
 
Eric: I don't know – really. Suddenly I felt I just had to laugh.
 
Sheila: You're squiffy.
 
Eric: I’m not.
 
Mrs Birling: What an expression, Sheila! Really the things you girls pick up these days!
 
Eric: If you think that's the best she can do-
Sheila: Don't be an ass, Eric.
 
Mrs Birling: Now stop it, you two. Arthur, what about this famous toast of yours?
 
Birling: Yes, of course. (clears his throat.) Well, Gerald, I know you agreed that we should only have this quiet little family party. It's a pity sir George and – we – lady croft can't be with us, but they're abroad and so it can't be helped. As I told you, they sent me a very nice cable – couldn't be nicer. I'm not sorry that we're celebrating quietly like this-
 
Mrs Birling: Much nicer really.
 
Gerald: I agree.
 
Birling: So do I, but it makes speech-making more difficult-
 
Eric: (not too rudely) Well . Don't do any. We'll drink their health and have done with it.
 
Birling: No, we won't. It's one of the happiest nights of my life. And one day, I hope, Eric, when you've a daughter of your own, you'll understand why. Gerald, I’m going to tell you frankly, without any pretences, that your engagement to Sheila means a tremendous lot to me. She'll make you happy, and I’m sure you'll make her happy. You're just the kind of son-in-law I always wanted. Your father and I have been friendly rivals in business for some time now – though crofts limited are both older and bigger than Birling and company – and now you've brought us together, and perhaps we may look forward to the time when Crofts and Birlings are no longer competing but are working together – for lower costs and higher prices. 
 
Gerald: Hear, hear! And I think my father would agree to that.
 
Mrs Birling: Now, Arthur, I don't think you ought to talk business on an occasion like this.
 
Sheila: Neither do I. All wrong.
 
Birling: Quite so, I agree with you. I only mentioned it in passin. What I did want to say was – that Sheila’s a lucky girl – and I think you're a pretty fortunate young man too, Gerald.
 
Gerald: I know I am – this once anyhow.
 
Birling: (raising his glass) So here's wishing the pair of you – the very best that life can bring. Gerald and Sheila.
 
Mrs Birling: (raising her glass, smiling) Yes, Gerald. Yes, Sheila darling. Our congratulations and very best wishes!
 
Gerald: Thank you.
Mrs Birling: Eric!
 
Eric: (rather noisily) All the best! She's got a nasty temper sometimes – but she's not bad really. Good old Sheila!
 
Sheila: Chump! I can't drink to this, can I? When do I drink?
 
Gerald: You can drink to me.
 
Sheila: (quiet and serious now) All right then. I drink to you, Gerald.
 
//for a moment they look at each other//
 
Gerald: (quietly) Thank you. And I drink to you – and hope I can make you as happy as you deserve to be.
 
Shelia: (trying to be light and easy) You be careful – or I’ll start weeping.
 
Gerald: (smiling) Well, perhaps this will help to stop it. (he produces a ring case.)
 
Sheila: (excited) Oh – Gerald – you’ve got it – is it the one you wanted me to have?
 
Gerald: (giving the case to her) Yes – the very one.
 
Sheila: (taking out the ring) Oh – it's wonderful! Look – mummy – isn't it a beauty? Oh – darling -
(she kisses Gerald hastily.)
 
Eric: steady the buffs!
 
Sheila: (who has put the ring on, admiringly) I think it's perfect. Now I really feel engaged.
 
Mrs Birling: So you ought, darling. It's a lovely ring. Be careful with it.
 
Sheila: careful! I'll never let it go out of my sight for an instant.
 
Mrs Birling: (smiling) Well, it came just at the right moment. That was clever of you, Gerald. Now, Arthur, if you've no more to say, I think Sheila and I had better go into the drawing room and leave you men-
 
Birling: (rather heavily) I just want to say this.(noticing that Sheila is still admiring her ring.) are you listening, Sheila? This concerns you too. And after all I don't often make speeches at you -
Sheila: I’m sorry, daddy. Actually I was listening.
 
//she looks attentive, as they all do. He holds them for a moment before continuing.//
 
Birling: I’m delighted about this engagement and I hope it won't be too long before you're married. And I want to say this. There's a good deal of silly talk about these days – but – and I speak as a hard-headed business man, who has to take risks and know what he's about – I say, you can ignore all this silly pessimistic talk. When you marry, you'll be marrying at a very good time. Yes, a very good time – and soon it'll be an even better time. Last month, just because the miners came out on strike, there's a lot of wild talk about possible labour trouble in the near future. Don't worry. We've passed the worst of it. We employers at last are coming together to see that our interests – and the interests of capital – are properly protected. And we're in for a time of steadily increasing prosperity. 
 
Gerald: I believe you're right, sir.
 
Eric: What about war?
 
Birling: Glad you mentioned it, Eric. I'm coming to that. Just because the kaiser makes a speech or two, or a few german officers have too much to drink and begin taking nonsense, you'll hear some people say that war's inevitable. And to that I say – fiddlesticks! The germans don't want war. Nobody wants war, except some half-civilized folks in the Balkans. And why? There's too much at stake these days. Everything to lose and nothing to gain by war.
 
Eric: Yes, I know – but still -
 
Birling: Just let me finish, Eric. You've a lot to learn yet. And I’m taking as a hard headed, practical man of business. And I say there isn't a chance of war. The world's developing so fast that it'll make war impossible. Look at the progress we're making. In a year or two we'll have aeroplanes that will be able to go anywhere. And look at the way the auto-mobile's making headway – bigger and faster all the time. And then ships. Why, a friend of mine went over this new liner last week – the titanic – she sails next week – forty-six thousand eight hundred tons – new york in five days – and every luxury – and unsinkable, absolutely unsinkable. That's what you've got to keep your eye on, facts like that, progress like that – and not a few german officers taking nonsense and a few scaremongers here making a fuss about nothing. Now you three young people, just listen to this – and remember what I’m telling you now. In twenty or thirty year's time – let's say, in 1940 – you may be giving a little party like this – your son or daughter might be getting engaged – and I tell you, by that time you'll be living in a world that'll have forgotten all these capital versus labour agitations and all these silly little war scares. There'll be peace and prosperity and rapid progress everywhere – except of course in russia, which will always be behindhand naturally. 
 
Mrs Birling: Arthur!
 
// has Mrs Birling shows signs of interrupting.//
 	Birling: Yes, my dear, I know – I’m talking too much. But you youngsters just remember what I Said. We can't let these Bernard Shaws and H.G.Wellses do all the talking. We hard-headed practical business men must say something sometime. And we don't guess – we've had experience - and we know.  
 
Mrs Birling. (rising. The others rise) Yes, of course, dear. Well don't keep Gerald in here too long. Eric – I want you a minute.
 
// she and Sheila and Eric go out. Birling and Gerald sit down again.// 
 
Birling: Cigar?
 
Gerald: No, thanks. Can't really enjoy them.
 
Birling: (taking one himself) Ah, you don't know what you're missing. I like a good cigar. (indicating decanter.) help yourself.
 
Gerald: Thank you.
 
// Birling lights his cigar and Gerald, who had lit a cigarette, helps himself to port, then pushes the decanter to Birling.//
 
Birling: Thanks. (confidentially.) by the way, there's something I’d like to mention – in strict confidence – while we're by ourselves. I have an idea that your mother – lady croft – while she doesn't object to my girl – feels you might have done better for yourself socially -
 
// Gerald, rather embarrassed, begins to murmur some dissent, but Birling checks him.//
 
 No, Gerald, that's all right. Don't blame her. She comes from an old country family – landed people and so forth – and so it's only natural. But what I wanted to say is – there's a fair chance that I might find my way into the next honours list. Just a knighthood, of course.
 
Gerald: Oh – I say – congratulations!
 
Birling: Thanks, but it's a bit too early for that. So don't say anything. But I’ve had a hint or two. You see, I was Lord Mayor here two years ago when royalty visited us. And I’ve always been regarded as a sound useful party man. So – well – I gather there's a very good chance of a knighthood – so long as we behave ourselfs, don't get into the police court or start a scandal – eh? ( laughs complacently.)
 
Gerald: (laughs) You seem to be a nice well-behaved family -
 
Birling: We think we are -
 
Gerald: So if that's the only obstacle, sir , I think you might as well accept my congratulations now.
Birling: No, no, I couldn't do that. And don't say anything yet.
 
Gerald: Not even to my mother? I know she'd be delighted.
 
Birling: Well, when she comes back, you might drop a hint to her. And you can promise her that we'll try to keep out of trouble during the next few months.
 
//they both laugh. Eric enters//
 
Eric: What's the joke? Started telling stories?
 
Birling: No. want another glass of port?
 
Eric: (sitting down) Yes, please. (takes decanter and helps himself.) mother says we mustn't stay too long. But I don't think it matters. I left'em talking about clothes again. You'd think a girl had never any clothes before she gets married. Women are potty about 'em.
 
Birling: Yes, but you've got to remember, my boy, that clothes mean something quite different to a woman. Not just something to wear – and not only something to make 'em look prettier – but – well, a sort of sign or token of their self-respect.
 
Gerald: That's true.
 
Eric: (eagerly) Yes, I remember – (but he checks himself.)
 
Birling: Well, what do you remember?
 
Eric: (confused) Nothing.
 
Birling: Nothing?
 
Gerald: (amused) Sounds a bit fishy to me.
 
Birling: (taking it in the same manner) Yes, you don't know what some of these boys get up to nowadays. More money to spend and time to spare than I had when I was Eric’s age. They worked us hard in those days and kept us short of cash. Thought even then – we broke out and had a bit of fun sometimes.
 
Gerald: I’ll bet you did.
 
Birling: (solemnly) But this is the point. I don't want to lecture you two young fellows again. But what so many of you don't seem to understand now, when things are so much easier, is that a man has to make his own way – has to look after himself – and his family too, of course, when he has one – and so long as he does that he won't come to much harm. But the way some of these cranks talk and write now, you'd think everybody has to look after everybody else, as if we were all mixed up together like bees in a hive – community and all that nonsense. But take my word for it, you youngsters – and I’ve learnt in the good hard school of experience – that a man has to mind his own business and look after himself and his own – and - 
 
// we hear the sharp ring of a door bell. Birling stops to listen.//
 
Eric: Somebody at the front door.
 
Birling: Edna'll answer it. Well, have another glass of port, Gerald – and then we'll join the ladies. That'll stop me giving you good advice.
 
Eric: Yes, you've piled it on a bit tonight, father.
 
Birling: Special occasion. And feeling contented, for once, I wanted you to have the benefit of my experience.
 
// Edna enters//
 
Edna: Please, sir, an inspector's called.
 
Birling: An inspector? What kind of inspector?
 
Edna: A police inspector. He says his name's Inspector Goole.
 
Birling: Don't know him. Does he want to see me?
 
Edna: Yes, sir. He says it's important.
 
Birling: All right, Edna. Show him in here. Give us some more light.
 
// Edna does, then goes out.//
 
I’m still on the bench. It may be something about a warrant.
 
Gerald: (lightly) Sure to be. Unless Eric’s been up to something. (nodding confidentially to Birling.) and that would be awkward, wouldn't it?
 
Birling: ( humorously ) Very.
 
Eric: (who is uneasy, sharply) Here, what do you mean?
 
Gerald: (lightly) Only something we were talking about when you were out. A joke really.
 
Eric: (still uneasy) Well, I don't think it's very funny.
 
Birling: (sharply, staring at him) what's the matter with you?
 
Eric: (defiantly) Nothing.
 
Edna: (opening door, and announcing) Inspector Goole.
 
// the Inspector enters, and Edna goes, closing door after her. The Inspector need not be a big man but he creates at once an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness. He is a man in his fifties, dressed in a plain darkish suit of the period. He speaks carefully, weightily, and has a disconcerting habit of looking hard at the person he addresses before actually speaking.// 
 
Inspector: Mr Birling?
 
Birling: Yes. Sit down Inspector.
 
Inspector: (sitting) Thank you, sir.
 
Birling: Have a glass of port – or a little whisky?
 
Inspector: No, thank you, Mr Birling. I'm on duty.
 
Birling: You're new, aren't you?
 
Inspector: Yes, sir. Only recently transferred.
 
Birling: I thought you must be. I was an alderman for years – and lord mayor two years ago – and I’m still on the bench – so I know the brumley police offices pretty well – and I thought I’d never seen you before.
 
Inspector: Quite so.
 
Birling: Well, what can I do for you? Some trouble about a warrant?
 
Inspector: No, Mr Birling.
 
Birling: (after a pause, with a touch of impatience) Well, what is it then?
 
Inspector: I’d like some information, if you don't mind, Mr Birling. Two hours ago a young woman died on the infirmary. She'd been taken there this afternoon because she'd swallowed a lot of strong disinfectant. Burnt her inside out, of course.
 
Eric: (involuntarily) My god!
 
Inspector: Yes, she was in great agony. They did everything they could for her at the infirmary, but she died. Suicide, of course.
Birling: (rather impatiently) Yes, yes. Horrid business. But I don't understand why you should come here, Inspector –
 
 
Inspector: (cutting through, massively) I’ve been round to the room she had, and she'd left a letter there and a sort of diary. Like a lot of these young women who get into various kinds of trouble, she'd used more than one name. But her original name – her real name – was Eva Smith.
 
Birling: (thoughtfully) Eva Smith?
 
Inspector: Do you remember her, Mr Birling?
 
Birling: (slowly) No – I seem to remember hearing that name – Eva Smith – somewhere. But it doesn't convey anything to me. And I don't see where I come into this.
 
Inspector: She was employed in your works at one time.
 
Birling: Oh – that's it, is it? Well, we've several hundred young women there, y'know, and they keep changing. 
 
Inspector: This young women, Eva Smith, was out of the ordinary. I found a photograph of her in her lodgings. Perhaps you'd remember her from that.
 
// Inspector takes a photograph, about postcard size, out of his pocket and goes to Birling. Both Gerald and Eric rise to have a look at the photograph, but the Inspector interposes himself between them and the photograph. They are surprised and rather annoyed. Birling stares hard, and with recognition, at the photograph, which the Inspector then replaces in his pocket.//
 
Gerald: (showing annoyance) Any particular reason why I shouldn't see this girl's photograph, Inspector?
 
Inspector: (coolly, looking hard at him) There might be.
 
Eric: And the same applies to me, I suppose?
 
Inspector: Yes.
 
Gerald: I can't imagine what it could be.
 
Eric: Neither can I.
 
Birling: And I must say, I agree with them, Inspector.
 
Inspector: It's the way I like to go to work. One person and one line of inquiry at a time. Otherwise, there's a muddle.
 
Birling: I see. Sensible really. (moves restlessly, then turns.) you've had enough of that port, Eric.
 
 // the Inspector is watching Birling and now Birling notices him.//
 
Inspector: I think you remember Eva Smith now don't you. Mr Birling?
 
Birling: Yes, I do. She was one of my employees and then I discharged her.
 
Eric: Is that why she committed suicide? When was this, father?
 
Birling: Just keep quiet, Eric, and don't get excited. This girl left us nearly two years ago. Let me see – it must have been in the early autumn of nineteen-ten.
 
Inspector: Yes. End of September, nineteen-ten.
 
Birling: That's right.
 
Gerald: Look here, sir. Wouldn't you rather I was out of this?
 
Birling: I don't mind your being here, Gerald. And I’m sure you've no objection, have you, Inspector? Perhaps I ought to explain first that this is Mr Gerald Croft – the son of Sir George Croft – you know, Crofts Limited.
 
Inspector: Mr Gerald Croft, eh?
 
Birling: Yes. Incidentally we've been modestly celebrating his engagement to my daughter, Sheila.
 
Inspector: I see. Mr Croft is going to marry Miss Sheila Birling?
 
Gerald: (smiling) I hope so.
 
Inspector: (gravely) Then I'd prefer you to stay.
 
Gerald: (surprised) Oh – all right.
 
Birling: (somewhat impatiently) Look – there's nothing mysterious – or scandalous – about this business – at least not so far as I’m concerned. It's perfectly straightforward case, and as it happened more than eighteen months ago – nearly two years ago – obviously it has nothing whatever to do with the wretched girl's suicide. Eh, Inspector? 
 
Inspector: No, sir. I can't agree with you there.
 
Birling: Why not?
 
Inspector: Because what happened to her then may have determined what happened to her afterwards, and what happened to her afterwards may have driven her to suicide. A chain of events.
 
Birling: Oh well – put like that, there's something in what you say. Still, I can't accept any responsibility. If we were all responsible for everything that happened to everybody we'd had anything to do with, it would be very awkward, wouldn't it?
 
Inspector: Very awkward.
 
Birling: We'd all be in an impossible position, wouldn't we?
 
Eric: By jove, yes. And as you were saying, dad, a man has to look after himself-
 
Birling: Yes, well, we needn't go into all that.
 
Inspector: Go into what?
 
Birling: Oh – just before you came – I’d been giving these young men a little good advice. Now – about this girl, Eva Smith. I remember her quite well now. She was a lively good-looking girl – country-bred, I fancy – and she'd been working in one of our machine shops for over a year. A good worker too. In fact, the foreman there told me he was ready to promote her into what we call a leading operator – head of a small group of girls. But after they came back from their holidays that August, they were all rather restless, and they suddenly decided to ask for more money. They were averaging about twenty-two and six, which was neither more nor less than is paid generally in our industry. They wanted the rates raised so that they could average about twenty-five shillings a week. I refused, of course.
 
Inspector: Why?
 
 Birling: (surprised) Did you say 'why?'? 
 
Inspector: Yes. Why did you refuse?
 
Birling: Well, Inspector, I don't see that it's any concern of yours how I choose to run my business. Is it now?
 
Inspector: It might be, you know.
 
Birling: I don't like that tone.
 
Inspector: I’m sorry. But you asked me a question.
 
Birling: And you asked me a question before that, a quite unnecessary question too.
 
Inspector: It's my duty to ask questions.
 
Birling: Well it's my duty to keep labour costs down. And if I’d agreed to this demand for a new rate we'd have added about twelve per cent to our labour costs. Does that satisfy you? So I refused. Said I couldn't consider it. We were paying the usual rates and if they didn't like those rates, they could go and work somewhere else. It's a free country, I told them.
 
Eric: It isn't if you can't go and work somewhere else.
 
Inspector: Quite so.
 
Birling: (to Eric) Look – just you keep out of this. You hadn't even started in the works when this happened. So they went on strike. That didn't last long, of course.
 
Gerald: Not if it was just after the holidays. They'd be all broke – if I know them. 
 
Birling: Right, Gerald. They mostly were. And so was the strike, after a week or two. Pitiful affair. Well, we let them all come back – at the old rates – except the four or five ring-leaders, who'd started the trouble. I went down myself and told them to clear out. And this girl. Eva Smith, was one of them, she'd had a lot to say – far too much – so she had to go.
 
Gerald: You couldn't have done anything else.
 
Eric: He could. He could have kept her on instead of throwing her out. I call it tough luck.
 
Birling: Rubbish! If you don't come down sharply on some of these people, they'd soon be asking for the earth.
 
Gerald: I should say so!
 
Inspector: They might. But after all it's better to ask for the earth than to take it.
 
Birling: (staring at the Inspector) What did you say your name was, Inspector?
 
Inspector: Goole. G. double O-L-E.
 
Birling: How do you get on with our chief constable, colonel Roberts?
 
Inspector: I don't see much of him.
 
Birling: Perhaps I ought to warn you that he's an old friend of mine, and that I see him fairly frequently. We play golf together sometimes up at the west brumley. 
 
Inspector: (dryly) I don't play golf.
 
Birling: I didn't suppose you did.
 
Eric: (bursting out) Well, I think it's a dam' shame.
 
Inspector: No, I’ve never wanted to play.
 
Eric: No, I mean about this girl – Eva Smith. Why shouldn't they try for higher wages? We try for the highest possible prices. And I don't see why she should have been sacked just because she'd a bit more spirit than the others. You said yourself she was a good worker. I'd have let her stay.
 
Birling: (rather angrily) Unless you brighten your ideas, you'll never be in a position to let anybody stay or to tell anybody to go. It's about time you learnt to face a few responsibilities. That's something this public-school-and-varsity life you've had doesn't seem to teach you.
 
Eric: (sulkily) Well, we don't need to tell the Inspector all about that, do we?
 
Birling: I don't see we need to tell the Inspector anything more. In fact, there's nothing I can tell him. I told the girl to clear out, and she went. That's the last I heard of her. Have you any idea what happened to her after that? Get into trouble? Go on the streets?
 
Inspector: (rather slowly) No, she didn't exactly go on the streets.
 
//Sheila has now entered//
 
Sheila: (gaily) What's this about streets? (noticing the Inspector.) Oh – sorry. I didn't know. Mummy sent me in to ask you why you didn't come along to the drawing-room.
 
Birling: We shall be along in a minute now. Just finishing.
 
Inspector: I’m afraid not.
 
Birling: (abruptly) There's nothing else, y'know. I've just told you that.
 
Sheila: What's all this about?
 
Birling: Nothing to do with you, Sheila. Run along.
 
Inspector: No, wait a minute, Miss Birling.
 
Birling: (angrily) Look here, Inspector, I consider this uncalled-for and officious. I've half a mind to report you. I've told you all I know – and it doesn't seem to me very important – and now there isn't the slightest reason why my daughter should be dragged into this unpleasant business.
 
Sheila: (coming father in) What business? What's happening? 
 
Inspector: (impressively) I'm a police Inspector, Miss Birling. This afternoon a young woman drank some disinfectant, and died, after several hours of agony, tonight in the infirmary.
 
Sheila: Oh – how horrible! Was it an accident?
 
Inspector: No. she wanted to end her life. She felt she couldn't go on any longer.
 
Birling: Well, don't tell me that's because I discharged her from my employment nearly two years ago.
 
Eric: That might have started it.
 
Sheila: Did you, dad?
 
Birling: Yes. The girl had been causing trouble in the works. I was quite justified.
 
Gerald: Yes, I think you were. I know we'd have done the same thing. Don't look like that Sheila.
 
Sheila: (rather distressed) Sorry! It's just that I can't help thinking about this girl – destroying herself so horribly – and I’ve been so happy tonight. Oh I wish you hadn't told me. What was she like? Quite young?
 
Inspector: Yes. Twenty-four.
 
Sheila: Pretty?
 
Inspector: She wasn't pretty when I saw her today, but she had been pretty – very pretty. 
 
Birling: That's enough of that.
 
Gerald: And I don't really see that this inquiry gets you anywhere, Inspector. It's what happened to her since she left Mr Birling's works that is important.
 
Birling: Obviously. I suggested that some time ago.
 
Gerald: And we can't help you there because we don't know.
 
Inspector: (slowly) Are you sure you don't know.
 
// He looks at Gerald, then at Eric, then at Sheila.//
 
Birling: And are you suggesting now that one of them knows something about this girl?
 
Inspector: Yes.
 
Birling: You didn't come here just to see me, then?
 
Inspector: No.
 
// the other four exchange bewildered and perturbed glances.//
 
Birling: ( with marked change of tone) Well, of course, if I’d known that earlier, I wouldn't has called you officious and talked about reporting you. You understand that, don't you, Inspector? I thought that – for some reason best known to yourself – you were making the most of this tiny bit of information I could give you. I'm sorry. This makes a difference. You sure of your facts?
 
Inspector: Some of them – yes.
 
Birling: I can't think they can be of any great consequence.
 
Inspector: The girl's dead though.
 
Sheila: What do you mean by saying that? You talk as if we were responsible--
 
Birling: (cutting in) Just a minute, Sheila. Now , Inspector, perhaps you and I had better go and talk this over quietly in a corner--
 
Sheila: (cutting in) Why should you? He's finished with you. He says it's one of us now.
 
Birling: Yes, and I’m trying to settle it sensibly for you.
 
Gerald: Well, there's nothing to settle as far as I’m concerned. I've never known an Eva Smith.
 
Eric: Neither have I.
 
Sheila: Was that her name? Eva Smith?
 
Gerald: Yes.
 
Sheila: Never heard it before.
 
Gerald: So were are you now Inspector?
 
Inspector: Where I was before, Mr Croft. I told you – that like a lot of these young women, she'd used more than one name. She was still Eva Smith when Mr Birling sacked her – for wanting twenty-five shillings a week instead of twenty-two and six. But after that she stopped being Eva Smith. Perhaps she'd had enough of it.
 
Eric: Can't blame her.
 
Sheila: (to Birling) I think it was a mean thing to do. Perhaps that spoilt everything for her.
 
Birling: Rubbish! (to Inspector.) Do you know what happened to this girl after she left my works?
 
Inspector: Yes. She was out of work for the next two months. Both her parents were dead, so that she'd no home to go back to. And she hadn't been able to save much out of what Birling and company had paid her. So that after two months, with no work, no money coming in, and living in lodgings, with no relatives to help her, few friends, lonely, half-starved, she was feeling desperate.
 
Sheila: (warmly) I should think so. It's a rotten shame.
 
Inspector: There are a lot of young women living that sort of existence in every city and big town in this country, Miss Birling. If there weren't, the factories and warehouses wouldn't know were to look for cheap labour. Ask your father. 
 
Sheila: But these girls aren't cheap labour – they're people.
 
Inspector: (dryly) I’ve had that notion myself from time to time. In fact, I've thought that it would do us all a bit of good if sometimes we tried to put ourselves in the place of these young women counting their pennies, in their dingy little back bedrooms. 
 
Sheila: Yes, I expect it would. But what happened to her then?
 
Inspector: She had what seemed to her a wonderful stroke of luck. She was taken on in a shop – and a good shop too – Milwards.
 
Sheila: Milwards! We go there – in fact, I was there this afternoon – (archly to Gerald) for your benefit.
 
Gerald: (smiling) Good!
 
Sheila: Yes, she was a lucky to get taken on at Milwards.
 
Inspector: That's what she thought. And it happened that at the beginning of December that year – nineteen-ten – there was a good deal of influenza about and Milwards suddenly found themselves short handed. So that gave her a chance. It seems she liked working there. It was nice change from a factory. She enjoyed being among pretty clothes, I've no doubt. And now she felt she was making a good fresh start. You can imagine how she felt.
 
Sheila: Yes, of course.
 
Birling: And then she got herself into trouble there, I suppose?
Inspector: After about a couple of months, just when she felt she was settling down nicely, they told her she'd have to go.
 
Birling: Not doing her work properly?
 
Inspector: there was nothing wrong with the way she was doing her work. They admitted that.
 
Birling: There must have been something wrong.
 
Inspector: All she knew was – that a customer complained about her – and so she had to go.
 
Sheila: (staring at him, agitated) When was this?
 
Inspector: (impressively) At the end of January – last year.
 
Sheila: What – what did this girl look like?
 
Inspector: If you'll come over here, I'll show you.
 
// He moves nearer a light – perhaps standard lamp – and she crosses to him. He produces the photograph. She looks at it closely, recognizes it with a little cry, gives a half-stifled sob, and then runs out. The Inspector puts the photograph back in his pocket and stares speculatively after her. The other three stare in amazement for a moment.// 
 
Birling: What's the matter with her?
 
Eric: She recognized her from the photograph, didn't she?
 
Inspector: Yes.
 
Birling: (angrily) Why the devil do you want to go upsetting the child like that?
 
Inspector: I didn't do it. She's upsetting herself.
 
Birling: Well – why – why?
 
Inspector: I don't know – yet. That's something I have to find out.
 
Birling: (still angrily) Well – if you don't mind – I'll find out first.
 
Gerald: Shall I go after her.
 
Birling: (moving) No, leave this to me. I must also have a word with my wife – tell her what's happening. (turns at the door, staring at the Inspector angrily.) We were having a nice family celebration tonight. And a nasty mess you've made of it now, haven't you?
 
Inspector: (steadily) That's more or less what I was thinking earlier tonight when I was in the infirmary looking at what was left of Eva Smith. A nice little promising life there, I thought, and a nasty mess somebody's made of it. 
 
// Birling looks as if about to make some retort, then thinks better of it, and goes out, closing door sharply behind him. Gerald and Eric exchange uneasy glances. The Inspector ignores them.// 
 
Gerald: I’d like to have a look at that photograph now, Inspector.
 
Inspector: All in good time.
 
Gerald: I don't see why -
 
Inspector: (cutting in, massively) You heard what I said before, Mr Croft. One line of inquiry at a time. Otherwise we'll all be taking at once and won't know where we are. If you've anything to tell me, you'll have an opportunity of doing it soon.
 
Gerald: (rather uneasily) Well, I don't suppose I have –
 
Eric: (suddenly bursting out) I'm sorry – but you see – we were having a little party – and I’ve had a few drinks, including rather a lot of champagne – and I’ve got a headache – and as I'm only in the way here – I think I'd better turn in.
 
Inspector: And I think you'd better stay here.
 
Eric: Why should I?
 
Inspector: It might be less trouble. If you turn in, you might have to turn out again soon.
 
Gerald: Getting a bit heavy-handed, aren't you, Inspector?
 
Inspector: Possibly. But if you're easy with me, I'm easy with you.
 
Gerald: After all, y'know, we're respectable citizens and not criminals. 
 
Inspector: Sometimes there isn't much difference as you think. Often , if it was left to me, I wouldn't know where to draw the line.
 
Gerald: Fortunately, it isn't left to you, is it?
 
Inspector: No, it isn't. But some things are left to me. Inquiries of this sort, for instance.
 
// Enter Sheila, who looks as if she's been crying.//
 
Well, Miss Birling?
 
Sheila: (coming in, closing the door) You knew it was me all the time, didn't you?
 
Inspector: I had an idea it might be – from something the girl herself wrote.
 
Sheila: I've told my father – he didn't seem to think it amounted to much – but I felt rotten about it at the time and now I feel a lot worse. Did it make much difference to her?
 
Inspector: Yes, I’m afraid it did. It was the last real steady job she had. When she lost it – for no reason that she could discover – she decided she might as well try another kind of life.
 
Sheila: (miserably) So I’m really responsible?
 
Inspector: No, not entirely. A good deal happened to her after that. But you're partly to blame. Just as your father is.
 
Eric: But what did Sheila do?
 
Sheila: (distressed) I went to the manager at Milwards and I told him that if they didn't get rid of that girl, I’d never go near the place again and I’d persuade mother to close our account with them.
 
Inspector: And why did you do that?
 
Sheila: Because I was in a furious temper.
 
Inspector: And what had this girl done to make you lose your temper.
 
Sheila: When I was looking at myself in the mirror I caught sight of her smiling at the assistant, and I was furious with her. I'd been in a bad temper anyhow.
 
Inspector: And was it the girls fault?
 
Sheila: No, not really. It was my own fault. (suddenly, to Gerald) All right, Gerald, you needn't look at me like that. At least, I'm trying to tell the truth. I expect you've done things you're ashamed of too.
 
Gerald: (surprised) Well, I never said I hadn't. I don't see why –
 
Inspector:(cutting in) Never mind about that. You can settle that between you afterwards. (to Sheila.) What happened?
 
Sheila: I'd gone in to try something on. It was an idea of my own – mother had been against it, and so had the assistant – but I insisted. As soon as I tried it on, I knew they'd been right. It just didn't suit me at all. I looked silly in the thing. Well, this girl had brought the dress up from the workroom, and when the assistant – miss Francis – had asked her something about it, this girl, to show us what she meant, had held the dress up, as if she was wearing it. And it just suited her. She was the right type for it, just as I was the wrong type. She was very pretty too – with big dark eyes – and that didn't make it any better. Well, when I tried the thing on and looked at myself and knew that it was all wrong, I caught sight of this girl smiling at miss Francis – as if to say: 'doesn't she look awful' – and I was absolutely furious. I was very rude to both of them, and then I went to the manager and told him that this girl had been very impertinent – and – and – (she almost breaks down, but just controls herself.) How could I know what would happen afterwards? If she'd been some miserable plain little creature, I don't suppose I’d have done it. But she was very pretty and looked as if she could take care of herself. I couldn't be sorry for her. 
 
Inspector: In fact, in a kind of way, you might be said to have been jealous of her.
 
Sheila: Yes, I suppose so.
 
Inspector: And so you used the power you had, as a daughter of a good customer and also of a man well known in the town, to punish the girl just because she made you feel like that?
 
Sheila: Yes, but it didn't seem to be anything very terrible at the time. Don't you understand? And if I could help her now, I would---
 
Inspector:(harshly) Yes, but you can't. It's too late. She's dead. 
 
Eric: My god, it's a bit thick, when you come to think of it----
 
Sheila: (stormily) Oh shut up, Eric. I know I know.
It's the only time I’ve ever done anything like that, and I’ll never, never do it again to anybody. I've noticed them giving me a sort of look sometimes at Milwards – I noticed it even this afternoon – and I suppose some of them remember. I feel now I can never go there again. Oh – why had this to happen?
 
Inspector: (sternly) That's what I asked myself tonight when I was looking at that dead girl. And then I said to myself: 'well, we'll try to understand why it had to happen?' and that's why I'm here, and why I’m, not going until I know all that happened. Eva Smith lost her job with Birling and company because the strike failed and they were determined not to have another one. At last she found another job – under what name I don't know – in a big shop, and had to leave there because you were annoyed with yourself and passed the annoyance on to her. Now she had to try something else. So first she changed her name to Daisy Renton-  
 
Gerald: (startled) What?
 
Inspector: (steadily) I said she changed her name to Daisy Renton.
 
Gerald: (pulling himself together) D'you mind if I give myself a drink, Sheila?
 
// Sheila merely nods, still staring at him, and he goes across to the tantalus on the sideboard for a whisky.//
 
Inspector: Where is your father, Miss Birling?
 
Sheila: He went into the drawing room, to tell mother what was happening here. Eric, take the Inspector along to the drawing-room.
 
// As Eric moves, the Inspector looks from Sheila to Gerald, then goes out with Eric.//
 
Well, Gerald?
 
Gerald: (trying to smile) Well what, Sheila?
 
Sheila: How did you come to know this girl – Eva Smith?
 
Gerald: I didn't.
 
Sheila: Daisy renton then – it's the same thing.
 
Gerald: Why should I have to known her?
 
Sheila: Oh don't be stupid. We haven't much time. You gave yourself away as soon as he mentioned her other name.
 
Gerald: All right. I knew her. Let's leave it at that.
 
Sheila: We can't leave it at that.
 
Gerald: (approaching her) Now listen, darling--
 
Sheila: no, that's no use. You not only knew her but you knew her very well. Otherwise, you wouldn't look so guilty about it. When did you first get to know her?
 
// he does not reply//
 
Was it after she left milwards? When she changed her name, as he said, and began to lead a different sort of life? Were you seeing her last spring and summer, during that time you hardly came near me and said you were so busy? Were you?
 
// he does not reply but looks at her.//
 
Yes, of course you were.
 
Gerald: I'm sorry, Sheila. But it was all over and done with, last summer. I hadn't set eyes on the girl for at least six months. I don't come into this suicide business.
 
Sheila: I thought I didn't half an hour ago.
 
Gerald: You don't. Neither of us does. So – for god's sake – don't say anything to the Inspector.
 
Sheila: About you and this girl?
 
Gerald: Yes. We can keep it from him.
 
Sheila: (laughs rather hysterically) why – you fool – he knows. Of course he knows. And I hate to think how much he knows that we don't know yet. You'll see. You'll see.
 
// she looks at him almost in triumph. He looks crushed. The doors slowly opens and the Inspector appears, looking steadily and searchingly at them.// 
 
Inspector: Well?
             END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
//  At rise, scene and situation are exactly as they were at end of act one. The Inspector remains at the door for a few moments looking at Sheila and Gerald. Then he comes forward, leaving door open behind him.//
Inspector: (To Gerald) Well?
Sheila: (with hysterical laugh, to Gerald) You see? What did I tell you?
Inspector:   What did you tell him?
Gerald:  (with an effort) Inspector, I think Miss Birling ought to be excused any more of this questioning. She'd nothing more to tell you. She's had a long exciting and tiring day – we were celebrating our engagement, you know – and now she's obviously had about as much as she can stand. You heard her.
Sheila: He means that I'm getting hysterical now.
Inspector: And are you?
Sheila: Probably.
Inspector: well, I don't want to keep you here. I've no more questions to ask you.
Sheila: no, but you haven't finished asking questions – have you?
Inspector: No.
Sheila: (to Gerald) You see? (to Inspector.) Then I'm staying.
Gerald: Why should you? It's bound to be unpleasant and disturbing.
Inspector: and you think young women ought to be protected against unpleasant and disturbing things?
Gerald: if possible – yes.
Inspector:  well, we know one young woman who wasn't, don't we?
Gerald:  I suppose I asked for that.
Sheila  : be careful you don't ask for more, Gerald.
Gerald:   I only meant to say to you – why stay when you'll hate it?
Sheila: It can't be any worse for me than it has been. And it might be better.
Gerald: (bitterly) I see.
Sheila: what do you see?
Gerald: You've been through it – and now you want to see somebody else put through it.
Sheila: (bitterly) so that's what you think I'm like. I'm glad I realized it in time, Gerald.
Gerald: no, no, I didn't mean -
Sheila: (cutting in) Yes, you did. And if you'd really loved me, you couldn't have said that. You listened to that nice story about me. I got that girl sacked from Milwards. And now you've made up your mind I must obviously be a selfish, vindictive creature.
Gerald: I neither said that nor even suggested it.
Sheila: Then why say I want to see somebody else put through it? That's not what I mean at all.
Gerald: All right then, I'm sorry.
Sheila: Yes, but you don't believe me. And this is just the wrong time not to believe me.
Inspector: (massively taking charge) allow me, Miss Birling. (to Gerald.) I can tell you why Miss Birling wants to stay on and why she says it might be better for her if she did. A girl died tonight. A pretty, lively sort of girl, who never did anybody any harm. But she died in misery and agony – hating life –
Sheila: (Distressed) don't please – I know, I know – and I can't stop thinking about it –
Inspector: (Ignoring this) now Miss Birling has just been made to understand what she did to this girl. She feels responsible. And if she leaves us now, and doesn't hear any more, then she'll feel she's entirely to blame, she'll be alone with her responsibility, the rest of tonight, all tomorrow, all the next night--
Sheila: (eagerly) Yes, that's it. And I know I'm to blame – and I'm desperately sorry – but I can't believe – I won't believe – it's simply my fault that in that in the end she – she committed suicide. That would be too horrible –
Inspector: (sternly to them both) You see, we have to share something. If there's nothing else, we'll have to share our guilt.
Sheila: (staring at him) yes. That's true. You know. (she goes close to him, wonderingly.) I don't understand about you.
Inspector: (calmly) there's no reason why you should.
// he regards her calmly while she stares at him wonderingly and dubiously. Now Mrs Birling. Enters, briskly and self-confidently, quite out of key with the little scene that has just passed. Sheila feels this at once.//
Mrs Birling: (smiling social) Good evening Inspector.
Inspector: Good evening, madam.
Mrs Birling: (same easy tone) I'm Mrs Birling, y'know. My husband has just explained why you're here, and while we'll be glad to tell you anything you want to know, I don't think we can help you much.
Sheila: No. Mother – please!
Mrs Birling: (affecting great surprise) What's the matter, Sheila?
Sheila:(hesitantly) I know it sounds silly--
Mrs Birling: what does?
Sheila: you see, I feel you're beginning all wrong. And I'm afraid you'll say or do something that you'll be sorry for afterwards.
Mrs Birling: I don't know what you're talking about, Sheila.
Sheila: we all started like that – so confident, so pleased with ourselves until he began asking us questions.
// Mrs Birling looks from Sheila to the Inspector.//
Mrs Birling: you seem to have made a great impression on this child, inspector.
Inspector: (coolly) we often do on the young ones. They're more impressionable.
//He and Mrs Birling look at each other for a moment. Then Mrs Birling turns to Sheila again//
Mrs Birling: you're looking tired, dear. I think you ought to go to bed – and forget about this absurd business. You'll feel better in the morning.
Sheila: mother, I couldn't possibly go. Nothing could be worse for me. We've settled all that. I'm staying here until I know why that girl killed herself.
Mrs Birling: nothing but morbid curiosity.
Sheila: no it isn't.
Mrs Birling: please don't contradict me like that. And in any case I don't suppose for a moment that we can understand why the girl committed suicide. Girls of that class--
Sheila:(urgently, cutting in) mother, don't – please don't. For your own sake, as well as ours, you mustn't--
Mrs Birling: (annoyed) mustn't – what? Really, Sheila!
Sheila: (slowly, carefully now) you mustn't try to build up a kind of wall between us and that girl. If you do, then the Inspector will just break it down. And it'll be all the worse when he does.
Mrs Birling: I don't understand you. ( to Inspector.) Do you?
Inspector: yes. And she'd right.
Mrs Birling: (haughtily) I beg your pardon!
Inspector: (very plainly) I said yes – I do understand her. And she's right.
Mrs Birling: that – I consider – is a trifle impertinent, Inspector.
// Sheila gives short hysterical laugh//
now, what is it, sheila?
Sheila: I don't know. Perhaps it's because impertinent is such a silly word.
Mrs Birling: in any case....
Sheila: but, mother, do stop before it's too late.
Mrs Birling: if you mean that the inspector will take offence-
inspector: (cutting in, clamly) no, no. I never take offence.
Mrs Birling: i'm glad to hear it. Though I must add that it seems to me that we have more reason for taking offence.
Inspector: let's leave offence out of it, shall we?
Gerald: I think we'd better.
Sheila: so do I.
Mrs Birling: (rebulking them) I'm talking to the inspector now, if you don't mind. (to inspector, rather grandly.) I realize that you may have to conduct some sort of inquiry, but I must say that so far you seem to be conducting in a rather peculiar and offensive manner. You know of course that my husband was lord mayor only two years ago and that he's still a magistrate--
Gerald: (cutting, rather impatiently) Mrs Birling, the inspector knows all that. And I don't think it's a very good idea to remind him--
Sheila: (cutting in) It's crazy. Stop it, please, mother.
Inspector: (imperturbable) Yes. Now what about Mr Birling?
Mrs Birling: He's coming back in a moment. He's just talking to my son, Eric, who seems to be in an excitable silly mood.
Inspector: What's the matter with him?
Mrs Birling: Eric? Oh – I'm afraid he may have had rather too much to drink tonight. We were having a little celebration here--
inspector: (cutting in) isn't he used to drinking?
Mrs Birling: No, of course not. He's only a boy.
Inspector: No, he's a young man. And some young men drink far too much.
Sheila: And Eric's one of them.
Mrs Birling: (very sharply) Sheila!
Sheila:(urgently) I don't want to get poor Eric into trouble. He's probably in enough trouble already. But we really must stop these silly pretences. This isn't the time to pretend that Eric isn't used to drink. He's been steadily drinking too much for the last two years.
Mrs Birling: (staggered) it isn't true. You know him, Gerald -and you're a man – you must know it isn't true.
Inspector:(as Gerald hesitates) Well, Mr Croft?
Gerald: (apologetically, to Mrs Birling) I'm afraid it is, y'know. Actually I've never seen much of him outside this house – but- well, I have gathered that he does drink pretty hard.
Mrs Birling: (bitterly) And this is the time you choose to tell me.
Sheila: yes, of course it is. That's what I meant when I talked about building up a wall that's sure to be knocked flat. It makes it all harder to bear.
Mrs Birling: But it's you – and not the inspector here – who's doing it--
Sheila: yes, but don't you see? He hasn't started on you yet.
Mrs Birling: (after a pause, recovering herself) if necessary I shall be glad to answer any questions the inspector wishes to ask me. Though naturally I don't know anything about this girl.
Inspector: (gravely) we'll see, Mrs Birling.
//enter birling, who closes door behind him//
Birling: (rather hot, bothered) I've been trying to persuade Eric to go to bed, but he won't. Now he says you told him to stay up. Did you?
Inspector: Yes, I did.
Birling: why?
Inspector: because I shall want to talk to him, Mr Birling.
Birling: I can't see why you should, but if you must, then I suggest you do it now. Have him in and get it over, then let the lad go.
Inspector: no, I can't do that yet. I'm sorry, but he'll have to wait.
Birling: now look here, inspector--
inspector: (cutting in, with authority) he must wait his turn.
Sheila: (to Mrs Birling) you see?
Mrs Birling: no, I don't. And please be quiet, Sheila.
Birling: (angrily) Inspector, I've told you before, I don't like the tone nor the way you're handling this inquiry. And I don't propose to give you much rope.
Inspector: you needn't give me any rope.
Sheila: (rather wildly, with laugh) No, he's giving us the rope – so that we'll hang ourselves.
Birling: (to Mrs Birling) What's the matter with that child?
Mrs Birling: over-excited. And she refuses to go. (with sudden anger, to inspector.) well, come along – what is it you want to know?
Inspector: (coolly) at the end of january, last year, this girl Eva Smith had to leave Milwards, because Miss Birling compelled them to discharge her, and then she stopped being Eva Smith, looking for a job, and became Daisy Renton, with other ideas. (sharply turning on him.) Mr Croft, when did you first get to know her?
// An exclamation of surprise from Birling and Mrs Birling. //
Gerald: where did you get the idea that I did know her?
Sheila: it's no use, Gerald. You're wasting time.
Inspector: as soon as I mentioned the name Daisy Renton, it was obvious you'd known her. You gave yourself away at once.
Sheila: (bitterly) of course he did.
Inspector: and anyhow I knew already. When and where did you first meet her?
Gerald: all right, if you must have it. I met her first, sometime in march last year, in the stalls bar at the palace. I mean the palace music hall here in brumley-
Sheila: well, we didn't think you meant buckingham palace.
Gerald: (to Sheila) thanks. You're going to be a great help, I can see. You've said your piece, and you're obviously going to hate this, so why on earth don't you leave us to it?
Sheila: nothing would induce me. I want to understand exactly what happens when a man says he's so busy at the works that he can hardly ever find time to come and see the girl he's supposed to be in love with. I wouldn't miss it for worlds--
Inspector: (with authority) yes, Mr Croft – in the stalls bar at the palace variety theatre . . .
Gerald: I happened to look in, one night, after a long dull day, and as the show wasn't very bright, I went down into the bar for a drink. It's a favourite haunt of women of the town--
Mrs Birling: women of the town?
Birling: yes, yes. But I see no point in mentioning the subject – especially -(indicating sheila.)
Mrs Birling: it would be much better if sheila didn't listen to this story at all.
Sheila: but you're forgetting I'm supposed to be engaged to the hero of it. Go on, Gerald. You went down into the bar, which is a favourite haunt of the women of the town.
Gerald: I'm glad I amuse you-
inspector: (sharply) come along, Mr croft. What happened?
Gerald: I didn't propose to stay long down there. I hate those hard-eyed dough-faced women. But then I noticed a girl who looked quite different. She was very pretty – soft brown hair and big dark eyes- (breaks off.) My god!
Inspector: what's the matter?
Gerald: (distressed) sorry – I – well, I've suddenly realized – taken it in properly – that's she's dead--
Inspector: (harshly) yes, she's dead.
Sheila: and probably between us we killed her.
Mrs Birling: (sharply) Sheila, don't talk nonsense.
Sheila: you wait, mother.
Inspector: (to gerald) go on.
Gerald: she looked young and fresh and charming and altogether out of place down here. And obviously she wasn't enjoying herself. Old joe meggarty, half-drunk and goggle-eyed, had wedged her into a corner with that obscene fat carcass of his--
Mrs Birling: (cutting in) there's no need to be disgusting. And surely you don't mean Alderman Meggarty?
Gerald: of course I do. He's a notorious womanizer as well as being one of the worst sots and rogues in Brumley--
Inspector: Quite right.
Mrs Birling: (staggered) well, really! Aldermand Meggarty! I must say, we are learning something tonight.
Sheila: (coolly) of course we are. But everybody knows about that horrible old Meggarty. A girl I know had to see him at the town hall one afternoon and she only escaped with a torn blouse--
Birling: ( sharply, shocked) sheila!
Inspector: (to gerald) go on, please.
Gerald: the girl saw me looking at her and then gave me a glance that was nothing less than a cry for help. So I went across and told Joe Meggarty some nonsense – that the manager had a message for him or something like that – got him out of the way – and then told the girl that if she didn't want any more of that sort of thing, she'd better let me take her out of there. She agreed at once.
Inspector: where did you go?
Gerald: we went along to the county hotel, which I knew would be quiet at that time of night, and we had a drink or two and talked.
Inspector: did she drink much at the time?
Gerald: no. she only had a port and lemonade – or some such concoction. All she wanted was to talk – a little friendliness – and I gathered that joe meggarty's advances had left her rather shaken – as well they might--
Inspector: she talked about herself?
Gerald: yes. I asked her questions about herself. She told me her name was Daisy Renton, that she'd lost both parents, that she came originally from somewhere outside Brumley. She also told me she'd had a job in one of the works here and had had to leave after a strike. She said something about the shop too, but wouldn't say which it was, and she was deliberately vague about what happened. I couldn't get any exact details from her about herself – just because she felt I was interested and friendly – but at the same time she wanted to be daisy renton – and not eva smith.
In fact, I heard that name for the first time tonight. What she did let slip – though she didn't mean to – was that she was desperately hard up and at that moment was actually hungry. I made the people at the county find some food for her.
Inspector: and then you decided to keep her – as your mistress?
Mrs Birling: what?
Sheila: of course, mother. It was obvious from the start. Go on,
gerald. Don't mind mother.
Gerald: (steadily ) I discovered, not that night but two nights later, when we met again – not accidentally this time of course - that in fact she hadn't a penny and was going to be turned out of the miserable back room she had. It happened that a friend of mine, Charlie Brunswick, had gone off to canada for six months and had let me have the key of a nice little set of rooms he had – in morgan terrace – and had asked me to keep an eye on them for him and use them if I wanted to. So I insisted on Daisy moving into those rooms and I made her take some money to keep her going there. (carefully, to the inspector.) I want you to understand that I didn't install her there so that I could make love to her. I made her go to morgan Terrace because I was sorry for her, and didn't like the idea of her going back to the palace bar. I didn't ask for anything in return.
Inspector: I see.
Sheila: yes, but why are you saying that to him? You ought to be saying it to me,
Gerald: I suppose I ought really. I'm sorry, sheila. Somehow i--
Sheila: (cutting in, as he hesitates) I know. Somehow he makes you.
Inspector: but she became your mistress?
Gerald: yes. I suppose it was inevitable. She was young and pretty and warm hearted – and intensely grateful. I became at once the most important person in her life – you understand?
Inspector: yes. She was a woman. She was lonely. Were you in love with her?
Sheila: just what I was going to ask!
Birling: (angrily) I really must protest--
Inspector: (turning on him sharply) why should you do any protesting? It was you who turned the girl out in the first place.
Birling: (rather taken aback) well, I only did what any employer might have done. And what I was in which my daughter, a young unmarried girl, is being dragged into this--
inspector: (sharply) your daughter isn't living on the moon. She's here in brumley too.
Sheila: yes, and it was I who had the girl turned out of her job at Milwards. And I'm supposed to be engaged to gerald. And I'm not a child, don't forget. I've a right to know. Were you in love with her, gerlad?
Gerald: (hesitatingly) it's hard to say. I didn't feel about her as she felt about me.
Sheila: (with sharp sarcasm) of course not. You were the wonderful fairy prince. You must have adored it, gerald.
Gerald: all right – I did for a time. Nearly any man would have done.
Sheila: that's probably about the best thing you've said tonight. At least it's honest. Did you go and see her every night?
Gerald: no. I wasn't telling you a complete lie when I said i'd been very busy at the works all that time. We were very busy. But of course I did see a good deal of her.
Mrs Birling: I don't think we want any further details of this disgusting affair--
Sheila: (cutting in) I do. And anyhow, we haven't had any details yet.
Gerald: and you're not going to have any. (to Mrs Birling.)
you know, it wasn't disgusting.
Mrs Birling: it's disgusting to me.
Sheila: yes, but after all, you didn't come into this, did you, mother?
Gerald: is there anything else you want to know – that you ought to know?
Inspector: yes. When did this affair end?
Gerald: I can tell you exactly. In the first week of september. I had to go away for several weeks then – on business – and by that time daisy knew it was coming to an end. So I broke it off definitely before I went.
Inspector: how did she take it?
Gerald: better than I'd hoped. She was – very gallant – about it.
Sheila: ( with irony) that was nice for you.
Gerald: No, it wasn't. ( he waits a moment, then in a low, troubled tone.) she told me she'd been happier than she'd ever been before – but that she knew it couldn't last – hadn't expected it to last. She didn't blame me at all. I wish to God she had now. Perhaps I'd feel better about it.
Inspector: she had to move out of those rooms?
Gerald: Yes, we'd agreed about that. She'd saved a little money during the summer – she'd lived very economically on what I'd allowed her – and didn't want to take more from me, but I insisted on a parting gift of enough money – though it wasn't so very much – to see her through to the end of the year.
Inspector: did she tell you what she proposed to do after you'd left her?
Gerald: No. she refused to talk about that. I got the idea, once or twice from what she said, that she thought of leaving brumley. Whether she did or not – I don't know. Did she?
Inspector: Yes. She went away for about two months. To some seaside place.
Gerald: By herself?
Inspector: Yes. I think she went away – to be alone, to be quiet, to remember all that had happened between you.
Gerald: how do you know that?
Inspector: she kept a rough sort of diary. And she said there that she had to go away and be quiet and remember ' just to make it last longer'. She felt there'd never be anything as good again for her – so she had to make it last longer.
Gerald: (gravely) I see. Well, I never saw her again, and that's all I can tell you.
Inspector: It's all I want to know from you.
Gerald: in that case – as I'm rather more – upset – by this business than I probably appear to be – and – well, i'd like to be alone for a while – I'd be glad if you'd let me go.
Inspector: Go were? Home?
Gerald: No. I'll just go out – walk about – for a while, if you don't mind. I'll come back.
Inspector: all right, Mr Croft.
Sheila: but just in case you forget – or decide not to come back, Gerald, I think you'd better take this with you. (she hands him the ring.)
Gerald: I see. Well, I was expecting this.
Sheila: I don't dislike you as I did half an hour ago, gerald. In fact, in some odd way, I rather respect you more than I've ever done before. I knew anyhow you were lying about those months last year when you hardly came near me. I knew there was something fishy about that time. And now at least you've been honest. And I believe what you told us about the way you helped her at first. Just out of pity. And it was my fault really that she was so desperate when you first met her. But this has made a diffence. You and I aren't the same people who sat down to dinner here. We'd have to start all over again, getting to know each other--
Birling: Now, sheila, I'm not defending him. But you must understand that a lot of young men-
Sheila: don't interfere, please, father. Gerald knows what I mean, and you apparently don't.
Gerald: Yes, I know what you mean. But I'm coming back – if I may.
Sheila: all right.
Mrs Birling: Well, really, I don't know. I think we've just about come to an end of this wretched business--
Gerald: I don't think so. Excuse me.
// he goes out. They watch him go in silence. We hear the front door slam.//
Sheila: ( to inspector) you know, you never showed him that photograph of her.
Inspector: No. it wasn't necessary. And I thought it better not to.
Mrs Birling: you have a photograph of this girl?
Inspector: Yes. I think you'd better look at it.
Mrs Birling: I don't see any particular reason why I should-
Inspector: probably not. But you'd better look at it.
Mrs Birling: very well. (he produces the photograph and she looks hard at it.)
inspector: (taking back the photograph) you recognize her?
Mrs Birling: No. why should I?
Inspector: of course she might have changed lately, but I can't believe she could have changed so much.
Mrs Birling: I don't understand you, Inspector.
Inspector: you mean you don't choose to do, Mrs Birling.
Mrs Birling: (angrily) I meant what I said.
Inspector: you're not telling me the truth.
Mrs Birling: I beg your pardon!
Birling: (angrily, to Inspector) Look here, I'm not going to have this, Inspector. You'll apologize at once.
Inspector: Apologize for what – doing my duty?
Birling: No, for being so offensive about it. I'm a public man-
Inspector: (massively) Public men, Mr Birling, have responsibilities as well as privileges.
Birling: Possibly. But you weren't asked to come here to talk to me about my reponsibilities.
Sheila: Let's hope not. Though I'm beginning to wonder.
Mrs Birling: Does that mean anything, sheila?
Sheila: it means that we've no excuse now for putting on airs and that if we've any sense we won't try. Father threw this girl out because she asked for decent wages. I went and pushed her farther out, right into the street, just because I was angry and she was pretty. Gerald set her up as his mistress and then dropped her when it suited him. And now you're pretending you don't recognize her from that photograph. I admit I don't know why you should, but I know jolly well you did in fact recognize her, from the way you looked. And if you're not telling the truth, why should the Inspector apologize? And can't you see, both of you, you're making it worse?
// she turns away. We hear the front door slam again.//
Birling: that was the door again.
Mrs Birling: Gerald must have come back.
Inspector: unless your son has just gone out.
Birling: I'll see.
// he goes out quickly. Inspector turns to Mrs Birling.//
Inspector: Mrs Birling, you're a member – a prominent member – of the Brumley Women's Charity Organization, aren't you?
// Mrs Birling does not reply.//
Sheila: Go on, mother. You might as well admit it. (to Inspector.) Yes, she is. Why?
Inspector: (calmly) It's an organization to which women in distress can appeal for help in various forms. Isn't that so?
Mrs Birling: (with dignity) Yes. We've done a great deal of useful work in helping deserving cases.
Inspector: there was a meeting of the interviewing committee two weeks ago?
Mrs Birling: I dare say there was.
Inspector: you know very well there was, Mrs Birling. You were in the chair.
Mrs Birling: and if I was, what business is it of yours?
Inspector: (severely) do you want me to tell you – in plain words?
// enter Birling, looking rather agitated.//
Birling: that must have been Eric.
Mrs Birling: (alarmed) Have you been up to his room?
Birling: yes. And I called out on both landings. It must have been eric we heard go out then.
Mrs Birling: silly boy! Where can he have gone to?
Birling: I can't imagine. But he was in one of his excitable queer moods, and even though we don't need him here--
Inspector: (cutting in, sharply) We do need him here. And if he's not back soon, I shall have to go and find him.
// Birling and Mrs Birling exchange bewildered and rather frightened glances.//
Sheila: He's probably just gone to cool off. He'll be back soon.
Inspector: (severely) I hope so.
Mrs Birling: And why should you hope so?
Inspector: I'll explain why when you've answered my questions, Mrs Birling.
Birling: Is there any reason why my wife should answer questions from you, Inspector?
Inspector: yes, a very good readon. You'll remember that Mr Croft told us – quite truthfully, I believe – that he hadn't spoken to or seen eva smith since last september. But Mrs Birling spoke to and saw her only two weeks ago.
Sheila: (astonished) mother!
Birling: Is this true?
Mrs Birling: (after a pause) yes, quite true.
Inspector: she appealed to your organization for help?
Mrs Birling: yes.
Inspector: not as Eva Smith?
Mrs Birling: No, nor as Daisy Renton.
Inspector: as what then?
Mrs Birling: first, she called herself Mrs Birling--
Birling: (astounded) Mrs Birling!
Mrs Birling: Yes, I think it was simply a piece of gross impertinence – quite deliberate – and naturally that was one of the things that prejudiced me against her case.
Birling: And I should think so! Damned impudence!
Inspector: you admit being prejudiced against her case?
Mrs Birling: Yes.
Sheila: mother, she's just died a horrible death – don't forget.
Mrs Birling: i'm very sorry. But I think she had only herself to blame.
Inspector: was it owing to your influence, as the most prominent member of the committee, that help was refused the girl?
Mrs Birling: possibly.
Inspector: was it or was it not your influence?
Mrs Birling: (stung) Yes, it was. I didn't like her manner. She'd impertinently made use of our name, though she pretended afterwards it just happened to be the first she though of. She had to admit, after I began questioning her, that she had no claim to the name, that she wasn't married, and that the story she told at first – about a husband who'd deserted her – was quite false. It didn't take me long to get the truth – or some of the truth – out of her.
Inspector: why did she want help?
Mrs Birling: you know very well why she wanted help.
Inspector: No, I don't. I know why she needed help. But as I wasn't there, I don't know what she asked from your committee.
Mrs Birling: I don't think we need discuss it.
Inspector: you have no hope of not discussing it, Mrs Birling.
Mrs Birling: if you think you can bring any pressure to bear upon me, Inspector, you're quite mistaken. Unlike the other three, I did nothing I'm ashamed of or that won't bear investigation. The girl asked for assistance. We were asked to look carefully into the claims made upon us. I wasn't satisfied with the girl's claim – she seemed to me not a good case – and so I used my influence to have it refused. And in spite of what's happened to the girl since, I consider I did my duty. So if I prefer not to discuss it any further, you have no power to make me change my mind.
Inspector: Yes I have.
Mrs Birling: No you haven't. Simply because I've done nothing wrong – and you know it.
Inspector: (very deliberately) I think you did something terribly wrong – and that you're going to spend the rest of your life regretting it. I wish you'd been with me tonight in the infirmary. You'd have seen-
Sheila: (bursting in) No, no, please! Not that again. I've imagined it enough already.
Inspector: ( very deliberately) then the next time you imagine it, just remember that this girl was going to have a child.
Sheila: (horrified) No! Oh – horrible – horrible! How could she have wanted to kill herself?
Inspector: because she'd been turned out and turned down too many times. This was the end.
Sheila: mother, you must have known.
Inspector: it was because she was going to have a child that she went for assistance to your mother's committee.
Birling: Look here, this wasn't Gerald Croft-
Inspector: (cutting in, sharply) No, no. nothing to do with him.
Sheila: thank goodness for that! Though I don't know why I should care now.
Inspector: (to Mrs Birling) and you've nothing further to tell me, eh?
Mrs Birling: I'll tell you what I told her. Go and look for the father of the child. It's his responsibility.
Inspector: That doesn't make it any the less yours. She came to you for help, at a time when no woman could have needed it more. And you not only refused it yourself but saw to it that the others refused it too. She was here alone, friendless, almost penniless, desperate. She needed not only money but advice, sympathy, friendliness. You've had children. You must have known what she was feeling. And you slammed the door in her face.
Sheila: (with feeling ) mother, I think it was cruel and vile."

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes

Crazier, crazier"
Broken,lifehouse,2008,2000,"The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, is there healing?
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be okay

The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you"

Past and present, they don't matter, now the future's sorted out

It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
You're going, ""Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey""
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it over summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going, ""Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey""

And no, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Think it's not going to stay anyway, think it's overrated

Behind Blue Eyes,limp bizkit,2004,2000,"No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like to be mistreated
To be defeated behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

Sometimes (It's A Bitch),stevie nicks,1991,1990,"Well, I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I try to dance with
What life has to hand me
My partner's been pleasure
My partner's been pain
There are days
When I swear I could
Fly like an eagle
And dark desperate hours
That nobody sees
My arms stretched triumphant
On top of the mountain
My head in my hands
Down on my knees
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
I've reached in darkness
And come out with treasure
I've laid down with love
And I woke up with lies
What's it all worth
Only the heart can measure
It's not what's in the mirror
But what's left inside
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
You gotta take it as it comes
Sometimes it don't come easy
I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
And I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I tried to dance with
What life had to hand me
And if I could
I'd do it all over again
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes the picture
Just ain't what it seems
You get what you want
But it's not what you need
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Well it's a breeze
It's a breeze, it's a breeze"

Ain’t a badder nigga raw from the jaw than the Jabber-Jibber
When I get Stone like Sharon from Sliver
Equipped to riggedy-rip the microphone to shreds
Dread, yo come and hit these niggas in the head

Well I connect my rhymes like Lego, so l'eggo my Eggo
I burn ya like Waco, you need more than Maaco
I take it to ya crew and keep 'em moving like I'm U-Haul
I'm here to school y'all figgedy-faggots like RuPaul
I throw a screwball and strike out the MC
And if he temps me, I knock em out like Jack Dempsey
I burn some sensi and chase it wit' a Guinness
The illest, now hit me with the hook because I'm finished

To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (Don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (Hip-hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (Don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (Rip shit)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (Don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (Hip-hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (Don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (Rip shit)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (Don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (Hip-hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (Don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (Rip shit)"

Still Here,drake,2016,2010,"Doin' well, dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me—yeah

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—

Wow, all praise to the most high up..."
Did My Time,korn,2003,2000,"Realized I can never win
Sometimes feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin?
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we supposed to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Sometimes I can never tell
If I've got something after me
That's why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we suppose to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Betrayed, I feel so enslaved
I really tried, I did my time
I did my time
I did my time!
I did my time!
I did my time!

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Oh God, the anger's changing me!
Oh God, the anger's changing me!"
Tainted,slum village ,2002,2000," (T3)
Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love

Think of her think of me
Think about us, it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you stay, where you subject to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you be
Say he the type of nigga that's hella cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me
 (T3)
Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love

How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day
People'll smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free
Love is always free

Real love, true love, tainted love, real love
True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real

You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience what some women won't in they lifespan
I'm sayin

Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh then you'll, be, alright
(T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time, y'all, come on)
Then you'll, be, alright"
Chorus,erasure,1991,1990,"Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring

Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep

Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring

Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep

Holy Moses our hearts are screaming
Souls are lifting only dreaming
We'll be waiting some are praying
For a time when no one's cheatin'

The sunlight rising over the horizon
Just a distant memory the dawn chorus
Birds singing bells ringing
In our hearts in our minds...

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep"

You got me jumping
You're beautiful body sure is thumping
Hey I just want to talk to you
But you keep digging me
Like you got something else to do
She's fly
You're fly

Girl is truly def
Girl won't you be mine
She's fly
So fly
And fresh
And fresh
She's def
And I want to be your man
Hey
I didn't get your name
You got your numbers all in the air
Tell me what's your claim to fame
Hey
So you don't wanna listen
Well I'm just super cool crushin' to start dissin'
You walk around here with your butt on your back
Tell me baby, what's up like that
You have to drive off in a Cadillac
Tell me, baby (sure you're right)
What's up like that
She's fly
You're fly
And fresh
And fresh
Girl is truly def
Girl won't you be mine
She's fly
So fly

Already Missing You,gerald levert ,1995,1990,"Aw, girl, what's up? Aw, not again
So you're packin' your bags and you're leaving?
But that ain't right
You need to stay a while, think about it
But wait a minute, before you go
There's just one thing I want you to know

We both agree that this love ain't what it used to be
We just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you, baby
Girl, you'll always be my heart
It's gonna to be strange living without you
Ain't felt so empty before, no
See, I miss your smile and even your fussin'
When I left my clothes on the floor, oh, baby, say now

I'm gonna miss your face (Yes, I am, baby)
I'm gonna miss your moods (The little things you do when you're sad and blue, baby)
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you (Yeah, yeah, I'm already missing you)

It's hard to say goodbye (Goodbye), but things will be better
You go your way and I will go mine
Let's keep in touch, let me know how you're doing
Girl, things will change in time, said
Don't want you to leave, keep sayin' I'm sorry
But I guess I'm repeating myself
Girl, you know I'm here when you need a shoulder
I can't see you in the arms of someone else, oh, baby

I'm gonna miss your face (Such a pretty face, such a pretty face)
I'm gonna miss your moods (How you do what you do when you do it)
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you (Missin' you)
I'm gonna miss your face (Oh, yes I am, yes I am, baby)
I'm gonna miss your moods (I'm gonna miss your love, miss your love)
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you (I'll miss makin' love to you)
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you (I'm missin' you)

Already missin' you (Right now)
See, I know you're leavin' soon, baby
Already missin' you (Right now)
And I don't think I can live without you, baby, yeah, sun set (Oh, baby)
Even though you haven't gone (Even though you haven't gone yet)
I'm missin' you (Uh-huh)
Gonna cry, I'm gonna be lonely
Missin' you, baby (Goodbye, baby)
Funny face, funny face (Baby, baby)
I know 'cause it's your style (I'll miss your touch)
You know I see your face (I miss your lovin')
I know you're gettin' ready to leave
Not a thing gonna make me happy
The way I miss your style, baby (I miss you, babe)
I never thought you'd leave me, baby
I never thought you'd go
It's gonna be strange livin' without you, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
You know my name when you need a shoulder
I'll miss you, baby (To cry on)
I'll miss you, girl
I'll miss you, sugar
I'll miss you, girl
I'll miss your smilin', baby
Smile for me, baby
Before you leave, before you leave
Smile, girl
Smile, baby

Surrender,trixter,1991,1990,"Words of silence echo through this lonely room
Just a photograph and dreams that won't come true
I'll never know why I left you standin' in the rain
Cryin' tears of emptyness it's drivin' me insane
All I wanted was to love you
Never wanted to see you cry
All I need is just to hold you
I just can't say - Goodbye
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
You use words as weapons I use love as a shield
So tell me why are we on this battlefield
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down your arms and baby let's surrender
And thought my aim is true
I sometimes miss the mark
Ooh, in matters of the heart
But I'd give my life tonight
To hold you in my arms
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way
I just wanna hold you (surrender)
I just wanna love you (surrender)
I never meant to make you cry
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers of from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down you arms and baby let's surrender"
Blue Monday 1988,new order,1988,1980,"How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today


I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tеll me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to lеave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)"

Shadowboxin',genius/gza ,1996,1990,"Special technique- (Nigga, fuck that)
Spe-special technique of shadowboxin' (Goddamn)
The GZA, uh, goddamn (Uh, the GZA)
Pledge allegiance to the hip-hop (Uh, goddamn, the Method, uh)
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop, allegiance to the hip-hop (Goddamn, Maximillion, Maximillion, uh)
Yeah, yeah (Uh)
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop (What?)
Maximillion, Maximillion, Maximillion

I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speakin' scud missile, heat-seekin'
Johnny Blazin', nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozin'
Slip the cardiac, arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez
Burnin' to the third degree
Sneaky ass alley cat, top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin (That's right, all you corny-ass rap motherfuckers)
The special technique of shadowboxing (Better go back and check your fucking stacks)
Because your naps ain't nappy enough (Shadowboxing)
And your reach ain't rugged enough, bitch

Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now
Things are gettin' good, lookin' better now
...and some other shit

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special, special, special, special technique of shadowboxing
Shadowboxing

Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?"
Bat Country,avenged sevenfold,2005,2000,"He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I've known it from the start, all
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me, I'm
Too weird to live but much too rare to die"
Breathe,telepopmusik,2003,2000,"I brought you something close to me
Left for something you see though you're here
You haunt my dreams
There's nothing to do but believe
Just Believe
Just Breathe

Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe
Another day, just believe
Another day, just breathe

I'm used to it by now
Another day, just believe
Just breathe, just believe
Just breathe
Lying in my bed
Another day, staring at the ceiling
Just breathe, another day
Another day, just believe
Another day
I'm used to it by now
I'm used to it by now

Just breathe, just believe
Just breathe, just believe
Just believe, just breathe

Ooh Boy,rose royce,1978,1970,"Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
I watch you walk by my window
And I don't even know your name
But my heart skips a beat and I feel weak
When my eyes tell my heart he comes again
There's so many things I want to say
But each time I see you boy
The words just seem to fade away
Infatuation, love at first sight
I don't know I just know that the feeling is right
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
There's talk going around town
They say you love a girl and then you put her down
I hope with all my heart that it's not true
'Cause boy I'd wanna share my love with you
I know that's it not right
Nor is it lady-like
For a girl to come right out
And tell a guy how she feels
But I want you to know that deep down in my soul
I'm experiencing something wonderful and new
And it's...
You boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
When I go to bed at night
I hold my pillow tight
Pretending that it's you
And if I had one wish and wishes came true
I wish to be able to say these words to you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Oooh boy, I hope with all my might
You feel the same way too
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I wish I could make this dream come true
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Oooh boy, I hope with all my might
You feel the same way too"
Biological Didn't Bother,shaquille o'neal,1995,1990,"Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(chorus)

Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(Chorus)"
Did It For The Girl,greg bates,2012,2010,"I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash
I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl
I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget
I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl
I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her
I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight
Anything to make her mine, all mine, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl"
Point At You,justin moore,2013,2010,"I've always been one of them boys
Rolling around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights
Red light running, good time chasing
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Yea, point at you

Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone
I still like to get a little crazy
But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Point at you, yea

Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me
Lord knows I'm hard to hold
But I guess you kinda like all of my sides
And I ain't letting you go
Cause my best side is holding me close
Point at you, yeah

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Oh baby, I just point at you
Yeah girl
Girl I point at you
Oh babe my best side is you
Girl I point at you"
Something To Grab For,ric ocasek,1983,1980,"If you want to hang on to my shoulder
I'm standing here
If you want to do it all over
Let me get near
If you were another pretender
Oh I'd pass you by
If you were a lost weekender
Oh maybe I'd try
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna show me what it's like
If you want to talk about it
I got the time
When you're looking so enchanted
You cover my mind
If you think I'll wait forever
Oh maybe you're right
There's no such thing as now or never
There's only twilight
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
Oh give me something to grab for
When you gonna show me
Show me what it's like
If you want to think it over
Oh I'll just wait around
If you want to take me over
I won't turn you down
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
C'mon and give me something to grab for
You gotta show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
When you gonna give me something to grab for
You gotta put it in my sight
Oh give me something to grab for
You gotta show me what it's like
Give me something to grab for
Show me what it's like
You gotta give me something to grab for
Oh give me something to grab for
Show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
Show me what it's like"
Aaron's Party (Come Get It),aaron carter,2000,2000,"Here's a little bit of old school for ya
That goes a little something like this...

I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(Throw the party of the month)
No, the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
(No, send them to a show)
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though
I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin' home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...
The doorbell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Ain't nobody do it like Aaron can)
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around, come on
(Come get it)
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)
People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh what what
(Come get it)
(Come get it)

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na

Things are goin' great then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellas, yo, ya gotta get out
(Hey man I heard this was an open house)
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
Well I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)
Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and
Another kid broke the lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh what what
(Come get it)

People all around you gotta

From the left to the right, make noise

Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what

Na na na na
Na na na na

Aaron C's in the house, here we go
Come with it

Break it down
(go go go go go...)

Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double
I'm dead (you're done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test
The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left
(AARON!!!???!!!)
Grounded

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around, come on
(Come get it)
What...

Back To The World,tevin campbell,1996,1990,"I know you're thinking
I've been better off without you by my side
But baby, this season
I don't want another cold rainy July

You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
Cause I don't have you
You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
Cause I don't have you

Come back to the world
Come back to the world
Baby, back to my world

And I still remember
The way you used to gently touch my face
And since last December
I've discovered that no one can take your place



And when the nights get lonely
I think of what you told me
Saying that I was the one
La, do, day
La, do, doh
La, do, day
La, do, doh
Tell me you can feel it once again
I know that we can love
Like we did then
So, bring it on home"
Promises,barbra streis,1981,1980,"Here by my side
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less
Do you know
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
Out in a world of tears we
We were hanging on
We come together
We find the sun
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
Promises to be there
Life, where the few may not ever find a heaven

Don't Misunderstand Me,rossington collins b,1980,1980,"Well, I know where you're goin'
I see where you've been
Don't you know by now, you never take life on the chin
Still you sit and wonder why the past is gone
Baby, you'll go under if you don't carry on
Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you
Just you
I don't need no promises, just tell me the truth
Mister, keep it honest, that's all I ask of you
Don't be second-guessin', 'bout where you want to be
Baby, count your blessings 'cause you won't find one like me
Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you
Well now, lady, get your dress on, grab them fancy shoes
Honey, I'm ready and waiting on you
Time is surely wastin', we've so much to do
We're both too smart to be fakin'
And I know it doesn't matter which road we take
Or if it's your way or my way
Well, lady, let me tell you what we're gonna do
Uh huh
We're gonna ride every highway
Don't misunderstand me
Bet I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you

Strawberry Wine,deana carter,1996,1990,"He was working through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now, years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much?

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine"

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes

Now woman, stay away

Another Heartache,rod stewart,1986,1980,"I told you once I'm a jealous man
But you never want to listen to who I am
We're divided, completely out of touch
I guess that's why we seem to fight so much

Believe me, darling, this ain't no game
If you think I'll be your fool, you better think again
I know you love me, but it just ain't right
I'm sick and tired of fighting with you every night

You say you don't wanna hurt me
But you're doing things I can't explain
Oh baby, why don't you leave me?
'Cause you know I'll never change

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
But one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I'll find a honey to take a chance
And roll that dice into my past
She'll cover me for a little while
And show me love ain't out of style

I don't care how long it takes
My heart's in the hands of fate
Oh God I ain't asking much
Just a woman that I can trust

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
Oh but one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I wanna love that's strong and real
I gotta know just how it feels
Somebody to share my life
To hold onto through the night

It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I may get used to
Dragging my heart around"
Calling It Love,animotion,1989,1980,"I lay here beside you, just thinkin' all night
I believe that tomorrow would make things all right
I still tell you I love you, that you're forever mine
It makes you feel good and it buys me some time
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day
I never questioned my feelings before
I felt but I felt there was it, nothin' more
But I can't keep denying the truth in my heart
Ooh, the touching and talking but we're oceans apart
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day
I've been spending my life
Thinking you're the one
Now I'm holding my lies
And the damage was done
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love...
I've been calling it love..."

And they're saying that you're leaving
You're so unhappy
With the way that you've been living

We think we have the answers

It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change

Look in the mirror
And you see how you've been taken
Ooh, you won't surrender

Oh-oh-oh, we always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change (change)
It doesn't matter who you are

When you got your lucky break?
You're looking back now
And it seems like a mistake

How to say
How I feel

Are said too much
They're not enough

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told

To remind me
To find my own

Almost Home,craig morgan,2003,2000,"He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashin' 5 below
It was freezing rain and spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans

I was afraid that he was dead, I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes, I said, ""Old man are you OK?""

He said, ""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home""

Then he said, ""I's just comin' 'round the barn
'Bout the time you grabbed my arm
When I heard mama holler, ""Son, hurry up""
I was close enough for my old nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck

Cane poles on the tailgate, bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55, that's as close as I've been""

""Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone

I said ,""Old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission""

Right now I'd be fishin'""

Another Like My Lover,jasmine guy,1991,1990,"In my life, I feel so lucky

Could knock me off my feet
But now I'm happy, baby

I never knew a love so strong
Could actually turn me on
But now I'm happy, baby

Some Days Are Diamonds (Some Days Are Stone),john denver,1981,1980,"When you asked how I've been here without you
I like to say ""I've been fine"" and I do
But we both know the truth is hard to come by
And if I told the truth, that's not quite true

Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone

Now the face that I see in my mirror
More and more is a stranger to me
More and more I can see there's a danger
In becoming what I never thought I'd be

Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone

Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone"
Stop,sam brown,1989,1980,"All that I have is all that you've given me

Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true
Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
(I see you across the street)
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one
Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you
Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
If you love me
(You will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry
(That day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me
Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
Baby stop
Ooh you'd better stop
Ooh stop
Baby stop

Stop, stop stop

Sorry For Party Rocking,lmfao,2012,2010,"Sorry for party rocking

Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and they just called buffalo (Buffalo!)
Poppin' bottles in the house with the models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

Let's go
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, ""Turn it down!""
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like

Baby, baby, baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off Ciroc, off Patron, shit whatever's tasty!
We don't got no manners hanging off the rafters
Let's go drink for drink, a hundred bucks she won't out last us
Check my style, take a good look, I'm fresh, bitch
In my whip with music so loud I'm deaf, bitch
Getting brain at a red light with people watching
Sorry for party rocking

If you show up already toe up, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you're blacked out with your sack out, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you throw up in your hoe's cup, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if she has a hissy fit cause you're whiskey dick, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
Oh!

I don't give a fuck when I'm in the club
Sipping bub, really drunk, and I see a fat booty
Gotta have it, I'm a grab it, it's a habit, automatic like Uzi
Uzi with the sick flow
Make a chick go crazy and flash them ta-ta's
Redfoo, the dude, a true party rocker

I'm true to the game too
It's called beer pong and I can't lose
I got a bunch of bad bitches in the back
With Ciroc on tap and a little bit of Grey Goose, ooh
Oh yeah we killin shit
With our money we diligent
So here's a sorry in advance
No hard feelings bitch
Sorry for party rocking

The proteiform graph itself is a polyhedron of scripture. There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a purely deliquescent recidivist, possibly ambidextrous, snubnosed probably and presenting a strangely profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. To the hardily curio-sing entomophilust then it has shown a very sexmosaic of nym — phosis in which the eternal chimerahunter Oriolopos, now frond of sugars, then lief of saults, the sensory crowd in his belly coupled with an eye for the goods trooth bewilderblissed by their night effluvia with guns like drums and fondlers like forceps persequestellates his vanessas from flore to flore.

Amousin though not but. Closer inspection of the bordereau would reveal a multiplicity of person-alities inflicted on the documents or document and some prevision of virtual crime or crimes might be made by anyone unwary enough before any suitable occasion for it or them had so far managed to happen along. In fact, under the closed eyes of the inspectors the traits featuring the chiaroscuro coalesce, their con trarieties eliminated, in one stable somebody similarly as by the providential warring of heartshaker with housebreaker and of dramdrinker against freethinker our social something bowls along bumpily, experiencing a jolting series of prearranged disappoint-ments, down the long lane of (it’s as semper as oxhousehumper! generations, more generations and still more generations.
Say, baroun lousadoor, who in hallhagal wrote the durn thing anyhow? Erect, beseated, mountback, against a partywall, below freezigrade, by the use of quill or style, with turbid or pellucid mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted by visit of seer to scribe or of scribe to site, atwixt two showers or atosst of a trike, rained upon or blown around, by a right-down regular racer from the soil or by a too pained whittlewit laden with the loot of learning?
Now, patience; and remember patience is the great thing, and above all things else we must avoid anything like being or be-coming out of patience. A good plan used by worried business folk who may not have had many momentums to master Kung’s doctrine of the meang or the propriety codestruces of Carpri-mustimus is just to think of all the sinking fund of patience pos — sessed in their conjoint names by both brothers Bruce with whom are incorporated their Scotch spider and Elberfeld’s Calculating Horses.

Naysayers we know. To conclude purely negatively from the positive absence of political odia and monetary requests that its page cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of that period or those parts is only one more unlookedfor conclu-sion leaped at, being tantamount to inferring from the nonpre — sence of inverted commas (sometimes called quotation marks) on any page that its author was always constitutionally incapable of misappropriating the spoken words of others.
Luckily there is another can't to the questy. Has any fellow, of the dime a dozen type, it might with some profit some dull evening quietly be hinted — has any usual sort of ornery josser, flat — chested fortyish, faintly flatulent and given to ratiocination by syncopation in the elucidation of complications, of his greatest Fung Yang dynasdescendanced, only another the son of, in fact, ever looked sufficiently longly at a quite everydaylooking stamped addressed envelope? Admittedly it is an outer husk: its face, in all its featureful perfection of imperfection, is its fortune: it ex-hibits only the civil or military clothing of whatever passion — pallid nudity or plaguepurple nakedness may happen to tuck it — self under its flap. Yet to concentrate solely on the literal sense or even the psychological content of any document to the sore neglect of the enveloping facts themselves circumstantiating it is just as hurtful to sound sense (and let it be added to the truest taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting an intro from another fellow turning out to be a friend in need of his, say, to a lady of the latter’s acquaintance, engaged in performing the elaborative antecistral ceremony of upstheres, straightaway to run off and vision her plump and plain in her natural altogether, pre-ferring to close his blinkhard’s eyes to the ethiquethical fact that she was, after all, wearing for the space of the time being some definite articles of evolutionary clothing, inharmonious creations, a captious critic might describe them as, or not strictly necessary or a trifle irritating here and there, but for all that suddenly full of local colour and personal perfume and suggestive, too, of so very much more and capable of being stretched, filled out, if need or wish were, of having their surprisingly like coincidental parts separated don’t they now, for better survey by the deft hand of an expert, don’t you know? Who in his heart doubts either that the facts of feminine clothiering are there all the time or that the feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same time, only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from the other? Or that both may then be contemplated simultaneously? Or that each may be taken up and considered in turn apart from the other?
Here let a few artifacts fend in their own favour. The river felt she wanted salt. That was just where Brien came in. The country asked for bearspaw for dindin! And boundin aboundin it got it surly. We who live under heaven, we of the clovery kingdom, we middlesins people have often watched the sky overreaching the land. We suddenly have. Our isle is Sainge. The place.

About that original hen. Midwinter (fruur or kuur?) was in the offing and Premver a promise of a pril when, as kischabrigies sang life’s old sahatsong, an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings ob-served a cold fowl behaviourising strangely on that fatal midden or chip factory or comicalbottomed copsjute (dump for short) afterwards changed into the orangery when in the course of deeper demolition unexpectedly one bushman’s holiday its limon threw up a few spontaneous fragments of orangepeel, the last remains of an outdoor meal by some unknown sunseeker or place-hider illico way back in his mistridden past. What child of a strand — looper but keepy little Kevin in the despondful surrounding of such sneezing cold would ever have trouved up on a strate that was called strete a motive for future saintity by euchring the finding of the Ardagh chalice by another heily innocent and beachwalker whilst trying with pious clamour to wheedle Tip- peraw raw raw reeraw puteters out of Now Sealand in spignt of the patchpurple of the massacre, a dual a duel to die to day, goddam and biggod, sticks and stanks, of most of the Jacobiters.

The stain, and that a teastain (the overcautelousness of the masterbilker here, as usual, signing the page away), marked it off on the spout of the moment as a genuine relique of ancient Irish pleasant pottery of that lydialike languishing class known as a hurry-me-o’er-the-hazy.
Why then how?
Well, almost any photoist worth his chemicots will tip anyone asking him the teaser that if a negative of a horse happens to melt enough while drying, well, what you do get is, well, a positively grotesquely distorted macromass of all sorts of horsehappy values and masses of meltwhile horse. Tip. Well, this freely is what must have occurred to our missive (there’s a sod of a turb for you! please wisp off the grass!) unfilthed from the boucher by the sagacity of a lookmelittle likemelong hen. Heated residence in the heart of the orangeflavoured mudmound had partly ob-literated the negative to start with, causing some features pal — pably nearer your pecker to be swollen up most grossly while the farther back we manage to wiggle the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw. Tip.
You is feeling like you was lost in the bush, boy? You says: It is a puling sample jungle of woods. You most shouts out: Bethicket me for a stump of a beech if I have the poultriest no-tions what the farest he all means. Gee up, girly! The quad gos — pellers may own the targum but any of the Zingari shoolerim may pick a peck of kindlings yet from the sack of auld hensyne.
Lead, kindly fowl! They always did: ask the ages. What bird has done yesterday man may do next year, be it fly, be it moult, be it hatch, be it agreement in the nest. For her socioscientific sense is sound as a bell, sir, her volucrine automutativeness right on normalcy: she knows, she just feels she was kind of born to lay and love eggs (trust her to propagate the species and hoosh her fluffballs safe through din and danger!); lastly but mostly, in her genesic field it is all game and no gammon; she is ladylike in everything she does and plays the gentleman’s part every time. Let us auspice it! Yes, before all this has time to end the golden age must return with its vengeance. Man will become dirigible, Ague will be rejuvenated, woman with her ridiculous white bur-den will reach by one step sublime incubation, the manewanting human lioness with her dishorned discipular manram will lie down together publicly flank upon fleece. No, assuredly, they are not justified, those gloompourers who grouse that letters have never been quite their old selves again since that weird weekday in bleak Janiveer (yet how palmy date in a waste’s oasis!) when to the shock of both, Biddy Doran looked at literature.
And. She may be a mere marcella, this midget madgetcy, Misthress of Arths. But. It is not a hear or say of some anomo-rous letter, signed Toga Girilis, (teasy dear). We have a cop of her fist right against our nosibos. We note the paper with her jotty young watermark: Notre Dame du Bon March‚. And she has a heart of Arin! What lumililts as she fols with her falli-mineers and her nadianods. As a strow will shaw she does the wind blague, recting to show the rudess of a robur curling and shewing the fansaties of a frizette. But how many of her readers realise that she is not out to dizzledazzle with a graith uncouthre-ment of postmantuam glasseries from the lapins and the grigs. Nuttings on her wilelife!

Yet is it but an old story, the tale of a Treestone with one Ysold, of a Mons held by tentpegs and his pal whatholoosed on the run, what Cadman could but Badman wouldn’t, any Genoaman against any Venis, and why Kate takes charge of the waxworks.

Drawing nearer to take our slant at it (since after all it has met with misfortune while all underground), let us see all there may remain to be seen.
I am a worker, a tombstone mason, anxious to pleace avery-buries and jully glad when Christmas comes his once ayear. You are a poorjoist, unctuous to polise nopebobbies and tunnibelly soully when ’tis thime took o’er home, gin. We cannot say aye to aye. We cannot smile noes from noes. Still. One cannot help noticing that rather more than half of the lines run north-south in the Nemzes and Bukarahast directions while the others go west-east in search from Maliziies with Bulgarad for, tiny tot though it looks when schtschupnistling alongside other incuna-bula, it has its cardinal points for all that. These ruled barriers along which the traced words, run, march, halt, walk, stumble at doubtful points, stumble up again in comparative safety seem to have been drawn first of all in a pretty checker with lamp-black and blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian of course, but the use of the homeborn shillelagh as an aid to calligraphy shows a distinct advance from savagery to barbarism. It is seriously believed by some that the intention may have been geodetic, or, in the view of the cannier, domestic economical. But by writing thithaways end to end and turning, turning and end to end hithaways writing and with lines of litters slittering up and louds of latters slettering down, the old semetomyplace and jupetbackagain from tham Let Rise till Hum Lit. Sleep, where in the waste is the wisdom?
Another point, in addition to the original sand, pounce pow-der, drunkard paper or soft rag used (any vet or inhanger in ous sot’s social can see the seen for seemself, a wee ftofty od room, the cheery spluttered on the one karrig, a darka disheen of voos from Dalbania, any gotsquantity of racky, a portogal and some buk setting out on the sofer, you remember the sort of softball sucker motru used to tell us when we were all biribiyas or nippies and messas) it has acquired accretions of terricious matter whilst loitering in the past. The teatimestained terminal (say not the tag, mummer, or our show’s a failure!) is a cosy little brown study all to oneself and, whether it be thumb-print, mademark or just a poor trait of the artless, its importance in establishing the identities in the writer complexus (for if the hand was one, the minds of active and agitated were more than so) will be best appreciated by never forgetting that both before and after the battle of the Boyne it was a habit not to sign letters always. Tip. And it is surely a lesser ignorance to write a word with every consonant too few than to add all too many. The end? Say it with missiles then and thus arabesque the page. You have your cup of scalding Souchong, your taper’s waxen drop, your cat’s paw, the clove or coffinnail you chewed or champed as you worded it, your lark in clear air. So why, pray, sign any-thing as long as every word, letter, penstroke, paperspace is a perfect signature of its own? A true friend is known much more easily, and better into the bargain, by his personal touch, habits of full or undress, movements, response to appeals for charity than by his footwear, say. And, speaking anent Tiberias and other incestuish salacities among gerontophils, a word of warning about the tenderloined passion hinted at. Some softnosed per-user might mayhem take it up erogenously as the usual case of spoons, prostituta in herba plus dinky pinks deliberatively summer-saulting off her bisexycle, at the main entrance of curate’s per — petual soutane suit with her one to see and awoh! who picks her up as gingerly as any balmbearer would to feel whereupon the virgin was most hurt and nicely asking: whyre have you been so grace a mauling and where were you chaste me child? Be who, farther potential? and so wider but we grisly old Sykos who have done our unsmiling bit on ‘alices, when they were yung and easily freudened, in the penumbra of the procuring room and what oracular comepression we have had apply to them! could (did we care to sell our feebought silence in camera) tell our very moistnostrilled one that father in such virgated contexts is not always that undemonstrative relative (often held up to our contumacy) who settles our hashbill for us and what an innocent all — abroad’s adverb such as Michaelly looks like can be suggestive of under the pudendascope and, finally, what a neurasthene nym-pholept, endocrine-pineal typus, of inverted parentage with a prepossessing drauma present in her past and a priapic urge for congress with agnates before cognates fundamentally is feeling for under her lubricitous meiosis when she refers with liking to some feeler she fancie’s face. And Mm. We could. Yet what need to say? ’Tis as human a little story as paper could well carry, in affect, as singsing so Salaman susuing to swittvitles while as unbluffingly blurtubruskblunt as an Esra? the cat, the cat’s meeter, the meeter’s cat’s wife, the meeter’s cat’s wife’s half better, the meeter’s cat’s wife’s half better’s meeter, and so back to our horses, for we also know, what we have perused from the pages of I Was A Gemral, that Showting up of Bulsklivism by ‘Schot-tenboum’, that Father Michael about this red time of the white terror equals the old regime and Margaret is the social revolution while cakes mean the party funds and dear thank you signifies national gratitude. In fine, we have heard, as it happened, of Spartacus intercellular. We are not corknered yet, dead hand! We can recall, with voluntears, the froggy jew, and sweeter far ’twere now westhinks in Dumbil’s fair city ere one more year is o’er. We tourned our coasts to the good gay tunes. When from down swords the sea merged the oldowth guns and answer made the bold O’ Dwyer. But. Est modest in verbos. Let a prostitute be whoso stands before a door and winks or parks herself in the fornix near a makeussin wall (sinsin! sinsin!) and the curate one who brings strong waters (gingin! gingin!), but also, and dinna forget, that there is many asleeps between someathome’s first and moreinausland’s last and that the beautiful presence of waiting kates will until life’s (!) be more than enough to make any milkmike in the language of sweet tarts punch hell’s hate into his twin nicky and that Maggy’s tea, or your majesty, if heard as a boost from a born gentleman is (?). For if the lingo gasped between kicksheets, however basically English, were to be preached from the mouths of wickerchurchwardens and metaphysicians in the row and advokaatoes, allvoyous, demivoyelles, languoaths, les-biels, dentelles, gutterhowls and furtz, where would their prac — tice be or where the human race itself were the Pythagorean ses — quipedalia of the panepistemion, however apically Volapucky, grunted and gromwelled, ichabod, habakuk, opanoff, uggamyg, hapaxle, gomenon, ppppfff, over country stiles, behind slated dwellinghouses, down blind lanes, or, when all fruit fails, under some sacking left on a coarse cart? So hath been, love: tis tis: and will be: till wears and tears and ages. Thief us the night, steal we the air, shawl thiner liefest, mine! Here, Ohere, insult the fair! Traitor, bad hearer, brave! The lightning look, the birding cry, awe from the grave, ever-flowing on the times. Feueragusaria iordenwater; now godsun shine on menday’s daughter; a good clap, a fore marriage, a bad wake, tell hell’s well; such is manowife’s lot of lose and win again, like he’s gruen quhiskers on who’s chin again, she plucketed them out but they grown in again. So what are you going to do about it? O dear!

Now, kapnimancy and infusionism may both fit as tight as two trivets but while we in our wee free state, holding to that prestatute in our charter, may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the lot, the interpretation of any phrase in the whole, the meaning of every word of a phrase so far de-ciphered out of it, however unfettered our Irish daily indepen — dence, we must vaunt no idle dubiosity as to its genuine author — ship and holusbolus authoritativeness. And let us bringtheecease to beakerings on that clink, olmond bottler! On the face of it, to volt back to our desultory horses, and for your roughshod mind, bafflelost bull, the affair is a thing once for all done and there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time, be it a day or a year or even supposing, it should eventually turn out to be a serial number of goodness gracious alone knows how many days or years. Anyhow, somehow and somewhere, before the bookflood or after her ebb, somebody mentioned by name in his telephone directory, Coccolanius or Gallotaurus, wrote it, wrote it all, wrote it all down, and there you are, full stop. O, undoubtedly yes, and very potably so, but one who deeper thinks will always bear in the baccbuccus of his mind that this down-right there you are and there it is is only all in his eye. Why?
Because, Soferim Bebel, if it goes to that, (and dormerwindow gossip will cry it from the housetops no surelier than the writing on the wall will hue it to the mod of men that mote in the main street) every person, place and thing in the chaosmos of Alle anyway connected with the gobblydumped turkery was moving and changing every part of the time: the travelling inkhorn (possibly pot), the hare and turtle pen and paper, the continually more and less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollabora-tors, the as time went on as it will variously inflected, differently pronounced, otherwise spelled, changeably meaning vocable scriptsigns. No, so holp me Petault, it is not a miseffectual why-acinthinous riot of blots and blurs and bars and balls and hoops and wriggles and juxtaposed jottings linked by spurts of speed: it only looks as like it as damn it; and, sure, we ought really to rest thankful that at this deleteful hour of dungflies dawning we have even a written on with dried ink scrap of paper at all to show for ourselves, tare it or leaf it, (and we are lufted to ourselves as the soulfisher when he led the cat out of the bout) after all that we lost and plundered of it even to the hidmost coignings of the earth and all it has gone through and by all means, after a good ground kiss to Terracussa and for wars luck our lefftoff’s flung over our home homoplate, cling to it as with drowning hands, hoping against hope all the while that, by the light of philo-phosy, (and may she never folsage us!) things will begin to clear up a bit one way or another within the next quarrel of an hour and be hanged to them as ten to one they will too, please the pigs, as they ought to categorically, as, stricly between ourselves, there is a limit to all things so this will never do.
For, with that farmfrow’s foul flair for that flayfell foxfetor, (the calamite’s columitas calling for calamitous calamitance) who that scrutinising marvels at those indignant whiplooplashes; those so prudently bolted or blocked rounds;

The unmistaken identity of the persons in the Tiberiast du-plex came to light in the most devious of ways. The original document was in what is known as Hanno O’Nonhanno’s unbrookable script, that is to say, it showed no signs of punctua — tion of any sort. Yet on holding the verso against a lit rush this new book of Morses responded most remarkably to the silent query of our world’s oldest light and its recto let out the piquant fact that it was but pierced butnot punctured (in the university sense of the term) by numerous stabs and foliated gashes made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually and correctly understood to mean stop, please stop, do please stop, and O do please stop respectively, and following up their one true clue, the circumflexuous wall of a singleminded men’s asylum, accentuated by bi tso fb rok engl a ssan dspl itch ina, — Yard inquiries pointed out þ that they ad bin “provoked” ay þ fork, of … grave BrofŠsor; …th ‚‘s BrŠak — fast — table;; ac — tely profŠssionally piqu‚d, to = introd — ce a notion of time  by p — nct! ingh oles (sic) in Ispace?!

Small need after that, old Jeromesolem, old Huffsnuff, old Andycox, old Olecasandrum, for quizzing your weekenders come to the R.Q. with: shoots off in a hiss, muddles up in a mussmass and his whole’s a dismantled noondrunkard’s son.

She's A River,simple minds,1995,1990,"Shadow let go
There's something you should know
I just found my new direction
And I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it
She's like the wind that sucked me through it
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me
Stand back - get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection
Got a resurrection feel
When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
And I go blind
Wasting my time
While the rivers in front of me
That's where I'm goin' to be
Shine on, get on
Twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the spirit of creation
She's the last chance guarantee
Got a myriad of poses
Sweet miracles and roses
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
'Cause when I find
My state of mind
The river's in front of me
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon
My nerves just feel electrified
Meet me on the staircase
Outside a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame
The voice of Mother Nature states
All things must pass
And nothing can remain
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
You raise me like a building to the very top
Rush me to the end of time
You fill me full of danger
You give me future shock
Then you leave me wasted dying
And I go blind
Wasting my time
The river's in front of me"
Out Of My Bones,r,1998,1990,"I'm in need of a remedy To cure me from loving you
It may sound a little extreme I'll do what I have to do
Chorus:
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
Keep walking till the hurting stops
Keep walking till my temperature drops
Keep walking till the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones
I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones
Sweet amnesia come and set me free
I just need to get you out of me"
All Fall Down,five star,1985,1980,"All fall down, all fall down
All fall down
I used to wake up at night
Feelin' so lonely
Before I knew you really loved me
I used to cry in my sleep
With tears on my pillow
I didn't think you wanted to know
But now you've change my world
I'm wondering how to keep myself from falling over
You're a special boy, my baby
And when you touch me
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home
I used to be so unsure
Afraid I'd discover
You want a friend but not a lover
But there's no fear in my mind
'Cause now we're together
Our love keeps growing bigger, be sure
I could jump for joy, you sweet thing
See me walk on air when people staring
They're looking at our mystery
And when, when you smile we
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I'll follow
'Cause you can lead me home
You're makin' me dance, make me sing
Anything, as long as you are here with me
I've found I can't touch the ground
You know you've made my inhibitions
(All fall down)
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known

Wherever you go I'll follow"
Ain't No Future In Yo' Fronting,m.c. breed ,1991,1990,"Intro : (Flavor Flav)
To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say ""How Breed?"" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)
There ain't no future in your frontin'

I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at 
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', ""Eric Breed is gettin' over""
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'
Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that
(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors
Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Hey man, let's start this party up, right?
(Beat y'all)

I need something to draw, need something to write on
I see electricity in the pylons
Look at it running the race, everything you doing erased
What it feel like? Hit with the mace
Tight pace that I'm keeping, got the reaper on me
Like you, what the hell would I be?
Without it, if you think it, shout it
Lost my mind, i think I found it, away
Live to fight, another bright day
I am God, so why would I pray?
You are God, above a white page
The creator, maker of rage
Painter paint the canvas, I ate the mantis
I saved the pandas, I hate they brand us
Can us like some Campbells
Jesus had no socks under his sandals
I can't ride a bike without the handles
I can't ride a scooter, have a tutor
Shoot the Buddha, eat some gouda
Say it ruder, tell who did I trample
Ramble on about some nonsense, I'm unconscious
I don't have cricket for a conscience
Kelp forest, where the magic conch is
Violent crucifying like I'm Pontius
Pilot flying high above Olympus
She's an angel, give that bitch a nimbus
Bengal tiger biting off your fingers
How am I supposed to eat these Pringles?
Image in your head is how I want it
Finish on the bed and lie upon it

I know what my momma asked
I just didn't answer
Got her foot up on the dash
She my tiny dancer

She my tiny dancer
Move it hula girl
Not a girl with cuter curls
I'ma stack these commas
We could be like the Obamas (Huh)
We could rule the world
Baby girl, just pick a country
Ain't worried bout no money
Ain't worried bout no-
-fast

Foot up on the gas
Everything we tend to pass
Leave it in the past
I know what my momma asked
I just didn't answer
Got her foot up on the dash
She my tiny dancer

Breakin-breaking down the gas
Don't want, smoke want cancer
You could-you could-you could ask
You can't get me canceled
Shake it-shake it-shake your ass
How it in your pants too?
How he do it?
You could ask
Grip this pen no pencil
Baby-baby-baby girl
Shake that ass for a nigga, I'll give you the world
Man, I love it how you bend your back and make it curl
Yeah, I put that necklace on yo' shit like pearls
Yeah, I cook that rock I stir it, make it twirl
Part 3

Yuh
I got a story for y'all (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, I do, I do, I do)
But I gotta kinda build it up a little bit (Lil bit, lil bit, lil bit)
I've been having a lot of bad dreams lately (I have, I have, I have)
And no matter what the fuck I do they won't go away
(They won't, they won't, they won't)
So I'ma talk about the place in my brain that I think they stay

Look
I had a dream about that nigga there in that photo (Okay, okay)
I had a dream that I shot you and yo' niggas in that photo
And it ain't right, bad dreams clouding up my sight
Can't get any rest in the night
Why the hell when I close my eyes am I not surprised? Someone always dies
Why the hell when when I close my pupils someone you lose comes to life
There ain't shit to fight, there ain't shit to point at with the pipe
Somethin' in my mental isn't right
Maybe it's all the hatin' ass niggas talkin' to me every day
About how the fuck they got a problem with what I be doin'
Maybe it's this hatin' ass bitch tellin' Lil Darkie not to say
The n-word even though she ain't knew him
And I'm always talking about spreadin' love and positivity
So maybe it's a little hard for me to put that shit behind me, and say screw 'em
Or lawyer up and go sue 'em, what am I doin'?
It's hard for me to let go of the hate
Especially when I want you to do great
Especially when them fuckers stall my fate
And you distractin' me because you ain't
Wit' it now my brain say slit it, take yo' blood and paint wit' it
Do it 'till you faint, do it 'till you can't anymore
I'll do this 'till I can't anymore
Is that my blood, or the paint on the floor?
Is that my blood, or the paint on the floor
I'm just a person who's mental state
Tend to worsen now I'm cursin' on a track
Oh you wear a beanie? That jack is my night cap
I'm spittin' heavy you ain't ready insider you might crack
I knew a mother of one son, one daughter, liked crack
She was my friend, she got kicked out of her apartment
For bringing the children harm, and it's scarring
My brain alarmin', I saw it
Her husband drink until he barely was thinking
They like my music though (Oh, we love your music!)
I see you got them bodies but you ain't actin' a human though
How you let your kids see you separate then abuse 'em though?
Momma smokin' cigs on the corner and daddy boozin' mo'
Now that bitch a racist 'cause her husband is
Fuckin' wit' darker faces, ain't puttin' dick where her waist is
And she can't afford no braces to give her daughter some teeth
But she talking to one my friends
About how she would suck his dick if he drove her to ATM
So she the pullin' the money out and she spendin' it all on coke
Now she broker and want it back so she switchin' over to crack
I rap about whippin' rock but I never do that for real
'Cause it's funny just when you talk and it's not when you skippin' meals
And it's not when your skin, it peels
And it's, not when you makin' deals
And it's not when you got the cops taking children away it feels
Too close to home
Part 4

Tell us another one, Darkie...
I'll try
(No ad-libs)
Fuck
Yuh
Yeah, yeah
Uh

Back in high school, uh, I had this girl
She meant the world to a nigga, that's a pearl, that's a gem
In the end, she ended up wit' my friend
Now let me tell you how this steaming pile of bullshit began
Back in sophomore year, I couldn't drop more tears (Uh)
Because my last girl kicked me to the curb, not in the city in the 'burbs
I'm sittin' pretty with the birds, finally over that shit
Uh, will anybody love me? Pulling clovers I rip, them out
In PE I'm sittin' out, but she just wanna talk
She invite me to her crib after class, okay, why not?
I'm door knockin', but she took me inside, led me to her room
Uh, then she pulled off all my clothes without askin' me she assumed I was for it
I should have known right there, mission abort it
Ain't no relationship she want, she want dick and she looking for it
She said, ""Did you bring the condoms"" as if I had caused a problem
I'm lying naked on her bed feeling raped and fucked in the head
So she apologized, ""I'm just into taller guys""
She said that she was in the wrong, and I shouldn't tell anyone
So I forgave her, first mistake
It's hard to say it when you love someone that person fake
Mistook attention for true love and so we start to date
I'm with the bitch for two years and it's perfect, wait
It's senior year and she telling me she want smoke
And do drugs like the lean and coke
And she thinkin' that datin' me it prevent her from bein' free
I'm like ""Baby, what do you mean? I been giving you everything
I been living my life for you, I thought we were part of a team?""
And so she leave, and my homie tell me I'll be fine, and that he really feel me
Dealing poorly start to smoke a lot, now I'm a fucking greenie
Caught a case, so she definitely stay away, no free me
At lunch I see her wit' him and I know that he can see me
Hoe meet me at the bike racks, fight back
You bony piece of shit, you was my homie, I ain't know that it was like that
But that nigga might be the reason that I write raps
Hope my Indian fingers might put a divot in yo' white ass
Uh, bullied in middle school and bullied after I did time
Commit crimes, I ain't worried 'bout fuckin', I want that money and I lick minds
Bumpin' ScHoolboy Q, having some sick times
Sellin' weed, and you know you my nigga if you get big dimes
I was born from the darkness, once an innocent kid, spray paintin' where the park is
Don't go swimmin' where the shark is
(Well, I hope you enjoyed that story of my youth
Now it's time for this journey through my mind to come to an end
I hope you're ready)
Part 5

(Please keep all hands, arms, feet, and legs inside your thoughts at all times)

Troubled kid with the troubled mind, troubled kid with the troubled past
In the trouble I grew up fast, in the rubble I sit my ass down
I’ll smoke you like I smoke that grass, I broke him like I broke that glass, I dropped out ain't got no class
Had to cut off a lot of friends, had to cut off a lot of people
Cause lots of people round me were evil, cause lots of niggas were weak and feeble
Ommmmmm...
Thank God that I got out alive
My momma never lost faith in my mind

When I was young
I used to play with Legos 'till the morning sun
I used to play with Legos now it's boring, son
No one would play with me, I’m the foreign one
He ain't had no butthole, so I tore him one
I didn't know what a country was now I'm touring one
All I wanna do is get on tracks, I was born to run
In the field I grip that stick, it's a hole in one
Why would you commit a crime with a stolen gun?
Rat-a-tat-tat, grip that gat, and push his hat back
Is yo momma proud of you now?
No she's not this much is true now

Possession,sarah mclachlan,1994,1990,"Listen as the wind blows
From across the great divide
Voices trapped in yearning
Memories trapped in time
The night is my companion
And solitude my guide
Would I spend forever here
And not be satisfied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Through this world I stumble
So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved
Oh you speak to me in riddles
And you speak to me in rhymes
My body aches to breathe your breath
Your words keep me alive

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Into this night I wander
It's morning that I dread
Another day of knowing of
The path I fear to tread
Oh into the sea of waking dreams
I follow without pride
It's nothing stands between us here
And I won't be denied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear
I hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes"

Sweet Thing,keith urban,2009,2000,"When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were driving' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were looking at me
I held open the car door for you then you climbed
Inside and slid on over
To the other side.. I thought my, oh my

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's mustang, its his favorite car
And so I can't stay long..
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me

Right Here,staind,2005,2000,"I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how could you collect them all and throw them in my face?

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending 'til I break

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
If you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away
Would you be right here waiting?
Searching for the things to say
To keep me right here waiting"
Dance For You,beyonce,2012,2010,"I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you, yes
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, yes
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, yes
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe, yes
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, yes
Wanna show you show you show you till you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is but you can never say how it used to be!

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

You'll never need two 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on you, babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me"
All I Want,susanna hoffs,1997,1990,"Can't ignore or hide away
Can't escape from the things that line our way
Take it, leave it, break it
Anyway, you can't get back to yesterday
All I want, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
You better listen from now on
Confidence, coincidence, call it a sin
It's just like people say
Tomorrow's here so open up your eyes
And never hesitate
All I want, all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on
It makes me want to give you everything
Pick you up and take you home again
Hold you tight and think that now is then
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Open arms or crying eyes
Say hello or wave goodbye
Which one are you thinking of?
All I want, all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
From now on
It's all I wanna do, all I wanna say
You better listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on
All I want do, all I want to say
Is everything I feel from now on"
One More Try,divine,1999,1990,"I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it is time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say that you love me
But if you don't
Just let me go
Chorus:
'Cuz teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to hold you, touch you
Don't think that you're mine
Because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl whose teacher has told
Her goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at you feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
(chorus)
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try"

R.I.C.O.,meek mill ,2015,2010,"Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O"

You've lost your love and you just can't carry on

You feel there's no one there for you to lean on

Every night you're out there, darling
You're always out there running

Confusion (confusion) - I leave it all up to you
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on

You feel there's no one there for you to lean on

Dark is the road you wander
And as you stand there under
The starry sky, you feel sad inside

Confusion (confusion) - you know, it's driving me wild
Confusion (confusion) - it comes as no big surprise
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on

Started strummin' this little groove
I could've wrote about love, or money, something sad, or something funny

But hey, hey, hey what's so wrong with one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song

And if by chance this brings you cheer maybe someday you'll bring me a beer
Or not to mention my favorite drink a marga-daiquiri-screw-aloda-on the beach

Hey, hey, hey what's so wrong with one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song

So here's to cheap whiskey and fine wine
Buyin' shots and pick up lines
And here's to bartenders tryin' to get paid
When all of us are tryin' to get ---

Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song

Frankly, it's a wrap, no bargain deals
I drive a four-wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up, baby, it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac?)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB the way I'm freakin'

Gonna get rowdy (Rowdy)
Gonna get a little unruly (Unruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (Hurry)
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party (Party)
Sweat drippin' over my body (Body)
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival
Gonna get rowdy
Bound to get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry

It's about time that I came to start the party (Oh, baby)
Sweat drippin' over my body
Wanna get a little bit naughty
Wanna get dirty
It's about time for my arrival

Closer To Fine,indigo girls,1989,1980,"I'm trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
The best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it, I'm crawling on your shore

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Closer I am to fine, yeah

I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper
And I was free

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Closer I am to fine, yeah

I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
When I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain
Yeah, we go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival, and we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine, yeah"
Second Chance,tyler collins,1990,1990,"I've been doing a lot of thinking
And I know I was wrong
I know we belong together
Look, this is kind of hard
For me to say to you
But I want you back, please
Just give me a second chance
I'm tired of living alone
The single life is not for me
Like a fool, I asked you for my freedom
I didn't think you'd leave so easily
Saw you just the other day
You were walking hand in hand
With someone new
It took me by surprise
And then, I realized
How much I needed you

A second chance for us
The second time could be better, baby
A second chance for love
This time around
We could make it, baby
Turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine
Ooh, we were so happy together
I never thought that I would
Swallow my pride
Now you're here
So please stay the night
I promise I will make it up to you
Don't ever go away
This love we've got to save
Cause no one else will do, no one

I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone
Oh, oh, yeah, ah, ah, yeah
I'm not meant to live alone
Why you being so difficult
You know you want me back
Come on, baby
Why you wanna treat me like that
I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby

Do I Wanna Know?,arctic monkeys,2014,2010,"Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

I'ma leave here with what I came here for, now what you sayin'?
You don't wan' take it there, don't go there with us, nah
Walked in with a Styrofoam cup with plenty racks off in my hands
And we ain't come here for to lose, we want it all
Smokin' dro 'cause I need it
So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason
Kick down your door, post up on your front porch, and we ain't leavin'

When my grandma died, I had to beat the odds and it wasn't easy
When Boozilla died, I almost lost my mind, broke me to pieces
We was slangin' iron for Dump and all the rest, it ain't no secret
38 across my neck, we be them boys you don't want beef with
Smokin' dro, smell it when I hit the door, 'cause I need it
I ain't the one, these pussy niggas know I be fiendin'
Hop out the car with diamonds 'round my throat, bitch, I'm beamin'
I don't think no nigga can't see me, I be paranoid while I'm leanin'

Smokin' dro 'cause I need it

Got a whole lot of people that need me
Bust your head all over the right thing
I ain't got nothin' but a dub and a Black Card up inside my Ami' jeans
I just want head, can't fuck in a bed, it's just some things don't excite me
Testin' your gun inside of the backyard, let it hit, get your aim up
My youngin official, he wait in your backyard, and I call him the bang thug
Wake up in the morning, get fresh as a bitch, I'ma walk in Dior and some Margielas
And the way we gon' dump at the boy with the stick, I'ma finish him off with a four nickel
I be thinkin' 'bout Dump all over the time, this shit just don't feel right
I don't go to no club, I be takin' these drugs, ridin' and keepin' that steel tight
Every night 'fore I sleep, I think 'bout the North Side where I grew up, no ho type

Break Up With Him,old dominion,2015,2010,"Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

To toot and talk all night long

And kiss me, sweet and strong
You're so square

You don't know any dance steps
That are new
But nobody else can love me
Like you do

I only know it does
I wonder why

Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

Yeah, loving you"

You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these

Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years

I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years"

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (yeah)

She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical

When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again (yeah) 

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (yeah)

Never very analytical
She is something simply beautiful
Re-appear when you feel magical
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
Yeah you know we're gonna win again

You're the one, you're the one who is the schizophrenic psycho

Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinkin' different
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let’s get ig'nant
She strips for the Gs, rake cash like leaves
She got double Ds, and ain’t shit free
Came with my goons but I’m leavin' with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain’t finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncin ass while I’m gettin' high as propellers on a helicopter

Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack
And a bucket but we nothin' but tatted
Bald-headed scallywags, real niggas salute me

Turn up, Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy
Toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl
Do a Montana line off of her titty
Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement
Feelin' so global, I think I need Asian
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt
I’m tryna get head while smokin' a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stockin'
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don’t buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Workin' for that money, bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat, bounce it

And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why

I don't love you anymore
I don't think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid

Promises, sweet promises
You kept them from your mind
Like all the lost forgotten things
You never seemed to find

Like all the disappointments
You displayed upon your shelf
Now you've got no-one to turn to
You've got no-one but yourself

And you say, why

Don't ask me, why

In the lion's den I can't get free
Now we're alone
Don't let me go
'Cause you're bringing out the savage beast in me

It's everywhere
I'm gonna be your prey tonight
I've given up the chase
I'm ready to be tamed
So tonight you better use your
Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight
Animal instinct - come to me
I wanna be your primitive lover
Set a trap
Then you attack
Bringing me to life with every bite
A single touch is just enough to stir the animal inside of me
Lost in your jungle
Weak from the heat
I'm gonna be your prey tonig
I won't hide anymore
Listen for the roar
I know tonight you're gonna use your
Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight...
A savage heart
Hungry for the touch
In the dark I'm ready for the hur
I hear the call
The call of the wild
Every night I need to feel your

How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?

Right Back,khalid ,2019,2010,"Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I’ve been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)
It’s crowded
In LA, but I’ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you’re down, I could show you around
If you’re really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it’s cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it (So bring it back)
So bring it, so bring it back (So bring it, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Nah)
So bring it, so bring it (Bring it, bring it)
So bring it, so bring it back
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like

Only Prettier,mir,2010,2010,"Well, I've been saved by the grace of southern charm
I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark card
If you wanna pick a fight
Well, I'm gonna to have to say good night
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heart
And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amends
It's easier, can't you see? Let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other, but it's sure fun to pretend

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Everybody says you gotta know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave, you could always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier
Hey


So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Well, I'll keep drinkin' and you'll keep gettin' skinnier
I'm just like you, only prettier"
Cowboys And Angels,dustin lynch,2012,2010,"There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

I've got boots and she's got wings
I'm hell on wheels and she's heavenly
I'd die for her and she lives for me
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

I'm not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Oh, maybe God just kinda likes
Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like you and guys like me
Cowboys and angels
Cowboys and angels"
Round Here Buzz,eric church,2017,2010,"Another Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz


Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz"
Poetic Justice,kendrick lamar ,2012,2010,"Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

""I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem.""
""Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?""
""Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry.""
""Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?""
""Enough with all this talkin'.""
""Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"""
Cowboy Song,thin lizzy,1976,1970,"I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
A starry night, a campfire light
The coyote call, the howling winds wail
So I ride out to the old sundown

I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female
The nights we spent together riding on the range
Looking back it seems so strange

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Riding in the rodeo

I was took in Texas I did not know her name
Lord, all these southern girls seem the same
Down below the border in a town in Mexico
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Running free with the buffalo
Here I go
Roll me over and I'll turn around
And I'll move my fingers up and down
Up and down
It's okay, amigo
Just let me go
Riding in the rodeo

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Riding in the rodeo
Roll me over and set me free
The cowboy's life is the life for me"

Soldier Of Love,sade,2010,2010,"I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the light
And the endless pool on the other side

It's the wild wild west
I'm doing my best
I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
I'm in the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I've been torn up inside
I've been left behind
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best to stay alive

I am love's soldier
I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I am lost but I don't doubt
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best to stay alive

I am love's soldier
I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier
Still wait for love to come

Silver Lady,david soul,1977,1970,"Tired of drifting, searching, shifting through town to town
Every time I slip and slide a little further down
I can't blame you if you won't take me back
After everything I put you through
But honey you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to
Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
Double talkers, backstreet walkers at every turn
Seedy motels and no star hotels still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my mind
Was the sweet love I had with you
And honey you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to
Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
Can't you find it in you to forgive me
Cause here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me

Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way
Well when they say you've lost your touch I smiled
They couldn't handle anything you're laying down
It's a fact you put the ""snap"" in crocodile
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
My aftershave has given my hiding place away
Stiletto heels a split skirt, you're a dream
But when you locked that bedroom door I screamed
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed

You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night?

She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool, relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a backseat, hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motorbike

I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine (fine)

Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey (Said I'm fine)
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey

I think about you, love you, and am filled with pride"
Take Your Time,tre,1997,1990,"The word ""love"" is a hell of a word to be sayin'
You don't know how to use it with caution
It's a death-defying game to play
And when you're thinking of the one you wanna get next to
Be sure it's a mutual feeling
'cause these are the words they'll say
""Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on""
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, ""Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed""
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled
Who do you  love? (You have to ask yourself)
Is it someone you can count on?
Someone who's there for you
Someone who will be true
No matter what the situation may be
And are they sent from above?
This question is asked for a reason
'Cause some of them wanna play
And then go their separate ways
And hey, these are the words they'll say

""Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on""
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, ""Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed""
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled

Ain't never had game, I shot real, shot real
'Cause complications in your conversation
So you know it ain't real, gotta be real
So why you keep fallin' for lames and games?
Shame shame shame
How many strippings you wanna take
Until you learn the game's another definition for play?
So, won't ya ease-a your mind and block out all distraction
Take your time
Take your time
Slow down  your action
Ya see, 'cause that's your disaster
Take your time
Ease my mind (Baby, won't you take your time?)
Take your time, help me ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find, I'm one of a kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled"
Best Part,daniel caesar ,2018,2010,"Oh, hey

You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are

It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love (Make love)

Don't Stand So Close To Me '86,the police,1986,1980,"Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt, they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and starts to cough

She Loves Me Not,papa roach,2002,2000,"When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that
She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk

Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fighting all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad
On the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
Tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk

Small Town Girl,john cafferty & the beaver brown b,1985,1980,"The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.
THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.

THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.
(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)
THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!
THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?
THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.
(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)
CISSY CAFFREY

I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)
THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.
(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)
PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.
PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!
CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)
She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.

(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)
STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.
(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)
THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.
THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)
EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.
STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.
(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)
LYNCH So that?
STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!
STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.
LYNCH Ba!
STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.
LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.
(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)
LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.
Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.
At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)
BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)
BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)
BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)
BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.
(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)
THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)
THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.
BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.
(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)
THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)
THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?
BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?
THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.
BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.
(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)
BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)
BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)
BLOOM O!
(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)
BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.
(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)
RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.
BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.
RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?
BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.
RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.
RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.
RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!
BLOOM Mamma!
ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?
(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)
A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!
BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.
(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)
BLOOM Molly!
MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.
(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.
(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...
MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.
BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!
(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)
THE SOAP
We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.

(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
SWENY Three and a penny, please.
BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
MARION (Softly.) Poldy!
BLOOM Yes, ma'am?
MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?
(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)
BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...
(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)
THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)
BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)
THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)
GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.
BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.
(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
MRS BREEN Mr.
BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .
MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!
BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!
BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.

(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.
BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?
MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.
BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.
MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.
MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.
BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)
ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.
MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?
MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.
(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)
RICHIE Best value in Dub.
(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!
BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.
MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.
BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?
MRS BREEN Let's.
(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)
THE BAWD Jewman's melt!
BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.
BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...
MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.
BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .
MRS BREEN Too.
BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .
MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!
(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.
(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)
THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)
THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?
THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.
THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!
PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.
PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!
PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.
THE NAVVY (Shouts.)
We are the boys. Of Wexford.
PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
THENAVVY (Shouts.)
The galling chain.
And free our native land.

(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)
BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.
(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)
Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)
THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)
THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)
FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.
(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)
THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.
BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)
BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)
SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.
BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)
SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.
FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.
BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.
FIRST WATCH Proof.
(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)
BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.
FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.
SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.
BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.
(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)
THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.
MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.
FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.
BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.
MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.
BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.
SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.
BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.
FIRST WATCH Regiment.
BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.
A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?
BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.
FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.
BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...
(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)
MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?
(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)
BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.
BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?
BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.
BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.
BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.
A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY
Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.

BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.
BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.
BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.
FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.
THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!
(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)
SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?
MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.
FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?
MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.
BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.
MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!
FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?
MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.
BLOOM She counterassaulted.
MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!
(General laughter.)
GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.
(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )
(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)
LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.
PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.
(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)
(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)
J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)
Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...

(He is howled down.)
J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.
BLOOM A penny in the pound.
(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)
DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.
(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)
J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)
BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...
MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.
MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.
MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!
(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)
THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.
MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.
MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.
MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.
(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.
BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.
MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!
MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!
BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.
MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.
BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)
MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?
BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.
(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)
DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.
(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)
THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)
Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo

(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)
THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.
(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)
THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.
THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?
THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.
THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.
FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.
SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.
THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.
(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)
THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)
(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)
LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?
(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)
RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.
(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)
THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!
BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .
HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.
SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!
(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)
PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.
(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)
BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?
PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!
BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.
SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?
FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.
PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.
A VOICE O rocks.
PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.
(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)
FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.
(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.
PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.
(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!
JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.
(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)
PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.
(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)
TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.
(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)
THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!
(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)
BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.
(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)
ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.
BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?
ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?
BLOOM Not I!
ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?
(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)
ZOE How's the nuts?
BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.
ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.
BLOOM Not likely.
ZOE I feel it.
(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)
BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.
ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?
(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)
ZOE You'll know me the next time.
BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.
(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)
ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.
BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.
ZOE And you know what thought did?
(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)
BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?
ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?
BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.
ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.
BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!
(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)
THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!
BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...
AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!
(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)
THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!
(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)
LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.
COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.
BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...
(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)
BLOOM'S BOYS
The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.

A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.
A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!
(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)
A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?
A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!
A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!
A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.
(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)
THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!
ALL God save Leopold the First!
BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.
WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?
BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.
MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!
(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)
THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.
(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)
BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.
(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)
JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!
BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.
(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)
TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.
BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.
THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!
JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.
A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!
AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.
AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.
BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.
(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)
THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)
(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)
THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.
BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!
(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)
THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!
THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS
Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.

(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)

BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.

BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!

THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!

(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)

BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.

(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)

JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.

PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?

BLOOM Pay them, my friend.

PADDY LEONARD Thank you.

NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?

BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?
BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.
BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?
BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.
LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.
BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.
CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.
BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.
ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?
BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.
O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.
DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!
BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.
LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?
(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)
FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.
MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!
MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!
NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.
BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)
I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.

HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.
PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!
BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)
LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!
THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.
BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.
THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.
THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)
(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)
ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!
THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)
BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.
DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.
(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)
DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.
DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.
(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)
BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.
MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.
(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)
A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?
BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.
BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.
BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.
(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!
(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)
THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You think the ladies love you!

THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.
(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)
MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!
(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)
MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.
BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!
(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)
REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.
THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!
BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.
(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)
THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!
BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.
(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)
THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.
(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)
ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.
BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.
ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.
BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.
ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.
BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?
ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?
BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.
ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.
BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.
ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.
BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.
ZOE Babby!
BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.
THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.
ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.
(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)
THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!
(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)
ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.
BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.
ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.
(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)
KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!
ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)
KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?
LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.
ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.
(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)
KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!
ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.
(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)
STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?
THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!
STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!
THE CAP Bah!
STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .
THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.
STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.
THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)
STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!
LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?
ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.
(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)
FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.
KITTY No!
ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!
FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.
(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)
THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.
(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)
STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.
(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)
ALL What?
THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)
FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!
(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)
THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...
(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)
THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?
(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)
ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...
THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.
(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)
THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!
ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.
KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.
ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.
FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.
STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.
(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)
THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.
LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.
(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)
BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.
(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)
MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.
(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)
THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!
(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)
ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?
LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.
ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?
LYNCH I'm not looking.
ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?
(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)
VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.
BLOOM Granpapachi. But...
VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
BLOOM She is rather lean.
VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.
VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.
VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...
BLOOM With?...
VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.
BLOOM The stye I dislike.
VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.
(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .
VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.
BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?
VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!
(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)
BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.
VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!
BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...
VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.
BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.
VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...
BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.
VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.
I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!

(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.
(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)
HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.
(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)
STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.
(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)
ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.
FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.
STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?
FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.
(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)
PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.
PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?
(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?
FLORRY And the song?
STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.
STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.
PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.
ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.
VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!
LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.
ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.
BLOOM Poor man!
ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.
BLOOM How?
VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.
KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.
PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?
PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.
(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)
LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.
FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.
ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.
LYNCH Three wise virgins.
VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!
(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)
BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.
(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)
THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!
A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.
BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.
HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.
VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!
(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)
THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.
HENRY All is lost now.
(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)
VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!
(Exeunt severally.)
STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.
LYNCH All one and the same God to her.
STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.
FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.
LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.
STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.
(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)
THE CARDINAL
Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.

(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.
(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.
(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.
(The trick doorhandle turns.)
THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.
ZOE The devil is in that door.
(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)
ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.
BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?
ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.
(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)
KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.
BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.
(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)
BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.
ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.
(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)
BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.
(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)
BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.
(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)
THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.
BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .
THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.
BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.
THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?
BLOOM Yes. No.
THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)
BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.
THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!
RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.
THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.
BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.
BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.
THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.
BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!
(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)
BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.
THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?
THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.
BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!
(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)
BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.
BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!
BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!
BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!
BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!
BELLO Dungdevourer!
BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.
BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!
BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!
(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)
BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.
BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.
BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.
(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.
ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.
BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.
FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.
KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.
BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.
BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.
(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)
BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!
BELLO (Twisting.) Another!
BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!
BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)
BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...
BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.
ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.
FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.
KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.
(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)
MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)
BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?
BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.
FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.
ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?
BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.
BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.
BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.
BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.
BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?
BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...
BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.
BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?
BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.
BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?
BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.
BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.
BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.
BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?
BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.
(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )
BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...
BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !
BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...
BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.
BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)
BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
BLOOM Thank you, mistress.
BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!
A BIDDER A florin!
(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)
A VOICE One and eightpence too much.
THE LACQUEY Barang!
CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.
VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.
BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.
BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.
BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?
BLOOM Eccles Street.
BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!
BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.
BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.
BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...
BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.
(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)
SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!
BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.
BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.
(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)
MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!
BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.
BLOOM They... I
BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.
BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...
A VOICE Swear!
(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)
BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.
BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?
(He bites his thumb.)
BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!
BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)
BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!
(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)
THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.
VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.
(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)
THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.
THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!
BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.
THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.
THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.
BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?
THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.
BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.
THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.
BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.
THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.
BLOOM You understood them?
THE YEWS Ssh.
THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.
THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!
BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.
(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)
THE WATERFALL
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.

THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.
JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!
THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?
BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.
(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)
THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!
(They cheer.)
BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!
THE ECHO Fool!
THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?
THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?
THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
THE WATERFALL
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.

THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!
BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?
(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)
STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.
BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.
(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)
THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!
BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)
THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?
(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)
COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...
BLOOM Done. Prff.
THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?
BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.
THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.
BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?
(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)
THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.
THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.
(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)
THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!
THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.
THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.
THE WATERFALL
Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.

THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!
THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.
(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)
THE BUTTON Bip!
(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)
THE SLUTS
O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.
THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!
THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!
BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?
THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !
BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.
(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)
BELLA You'll know me the next time.
BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.
BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!
BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.
BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?
ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.
(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)
BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.
ZOE
Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.

BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.
ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.
BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?
(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)
STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.
LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.
STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.
BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.
STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.
(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)
FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)
BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.
STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.
ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.
LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!
KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)
FLORRY And me?
LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)
STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.
BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.
BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.
ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)
BLOOM This is yours.
STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.
BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.
STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.
BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?
STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.
BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.
STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.
BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.
BLOOM No, but...
STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)
LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.
STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.
ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.
FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.
STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)
BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?
ZOE Is he hungry?
STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)
Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.

ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.
LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?
ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)
LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.
(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)
FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.
(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)
DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.
ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.
STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.
ZOE What day were you born?
STEPHEN Thursday. Today.
ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.
FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.
ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?
BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.
BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.
ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.
BLOOM Wrong.
ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?
(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)
BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.
(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)
BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.
ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.
STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?
(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)
FLORRY What?
(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)
THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?
(Bronze by gold they whisper.)
ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.
(They whisper again.)
(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)
LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?
BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.
LENEHAN A good night's work.
BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.
LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!
ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.
BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?
BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...
BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?
BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.
MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.
BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!
BELLA What? What is it?
(Zoe whispers to her.)
MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.
BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.
BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...
KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.
(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)
MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!
LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.
KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.
BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!
MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!
BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!
BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!
LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.
(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)
SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!
BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?
ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.
BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...
(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)
FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!
SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!
SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.
(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)
MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.
MARTIN CUNNINGHAM
(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!
STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.
BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.
LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.
ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.
(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)
LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.
STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!
LYNCH Vive le vampire!
THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!
STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.
BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...
STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)
BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...
THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!
STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.
ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.
LYNCH Across the world for a wife.
FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.
STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?
BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.
STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!
BLOOM I say, look...
STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!
(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)
SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!
(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)
THE CROWD
Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!

(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)
THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!
GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!
(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)
THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!
(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)
STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!
ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!
PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY
Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...

ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?
BLOOM Who'll.
LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.
STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)
ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.
(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)
ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?
(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)
MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!
(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)
THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.
(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)
MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!
(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)
HOURS You may touch my.
CAVALIERS May I touch your?
HOURS O, but lightly!
CAVALIERS O, so lightly!
THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.
(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)
MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!
(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)
THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!
ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!
MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!
(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)
ZOE I'm giddy.
(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)
MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!
(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)
MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!
THE PIANOLA
Best, best of all,
Baraabum!

KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!
(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)
THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.
ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!
(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)
STEPHEN Pas seul!
(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)
THE PIANOLA
Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.

(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)
TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!
SIMON Think of your mother's people!
STEPHEN Dance of death.
(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)
(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)
STEPHEN Ho!
(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)
THE CHOIR
Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...

(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)

BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.

THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.

STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?

BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.

THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.

STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.

THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.

STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.

THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.

STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!

THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.

ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!

FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.

BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.

THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!

STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!

THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)

STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)

BLOOM (At the window.) What?

STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!

FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)

THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!

STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!

THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.

STEPHEN Nothung!

(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)

THE GASJET Pwfungg!

BLOOM Stop!

LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!

BELLA Police!

(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!

(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)

THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.

ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.

BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.

BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?

A WHORE He tore his coat.

BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.

BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...

BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.

BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...

BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!

BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!

FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?

BELLA Do you want me to call the police?

BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.

BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!

BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.

BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?

ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.

BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!

(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)

STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.

PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?

STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.

CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.

STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.

VOICES She's faithfultheman.

CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.

PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.

PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?

LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.

PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.

STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.

CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.

STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...

PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?

STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.

(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?

DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.

(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)

BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.

STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.

(He staggers a pace back.)

BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.

STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.

BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.

CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.

BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.

CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.

PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?

(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.

(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)

PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.

STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)

My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.

STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...
PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.
BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.
STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.
PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.
STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.
(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)
KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.
(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)
PATRICE Socialiste!
DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!
BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.
STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.
BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.
THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.
THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!
A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.
THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)
May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.

THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)
I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.

RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.
(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)
THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.
(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)
RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!
EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)
On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!

PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?
STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.
PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?
STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...
(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)
STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!
OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?
STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.
CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!
A ROUGH Our men retreated.
PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.
BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.
THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!
(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)
PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.
STEPHEN Did I? When?
BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.
THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!
(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)
MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.
PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.
PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.
(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)
CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!
CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.
BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.
CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!
STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.
PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.
BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.
CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!
STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)
White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.

VOICES Police!
DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!
(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)
FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.
THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.
FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.
THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.
THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!
(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)
ADONAI Dooooooooooog!
THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!
(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)
ADONAI Goooooooooood!
(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)
PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!
OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!
BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?
LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)
STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.
BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.
STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.
CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.
BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.
PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.
(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)
MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!
THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.
THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!
(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)
What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!
THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.
(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)
THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.
BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!
PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!
(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)
FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?
PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?
CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?
A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.
BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...
SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?
PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.
BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.
SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.
PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.
FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?
BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.
FIRST WATCH Name and address.
(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)
BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.
SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.
CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?
FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.
(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)
CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?
FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.
CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?
SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.
CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.
SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.
CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.
BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.
FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.
SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.
FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.
BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.
SECOND WATCH It's our duty.
CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.
THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)
BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.
CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.
BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...
CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!
BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...
(The horse neighs.)
THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?
BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)
CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.
BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!
THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.
BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...
(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)
CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.
BLOOM Night.
(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)
BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!
STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...
(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)
BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!
(Murmurs.)
... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...

(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)
BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...
(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)
BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!
RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)"

Someday,rob thomas,2010,2010,"You can go
You can start all over again
You can try to find a way to make another day go by
You can hide
Hold all your feelings inside
You can try to carry on when all you wanna do is cry

And maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
Try to put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to make things better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

Now we wait
And try to find another mistake
If you throw it all away, then maybe you can change your mind
You can run
And when everything is over and done
You can shine a little light on everything around you
Man, it’s good to be someone


I don’t wanna wait
I just wanna know
I just wanna hear you tell me so
Give it to me straight
Tell it to me slow

‘Cause maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
We’ll put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to just to feel better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

‘Cause sometimes we don’t really notice
Just how good it can get
So maybe we should start all over
Start all over, again"
All I Want Is You,carly simon,1988,1980,"What do the neighbors say

They can never guess

That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here

Good morning, dear, no, no
All I want is you
All that I want is you

Let 'em listen through the floor
Let 'em go ahead and draw
The wrong conclusion

Make me crazy like the moon

Tiptoes up the stairs

The Grand Ole Opry coming to you live from ...
(radio static)

When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
""Ring Of Fire"" or ""Amazing Grace""

Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority

And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back


I wish I was in Dixie Again
I miss my Tennessee Home
I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

Look away, look away

Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I am slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying, crying, crying
And you, don't you know the tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry
Oh, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray, oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
(How could I be so wrong?)
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know the hearts will cause an inferno?
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected
(I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you collected
Oh, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily?
Well, I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out over you
Oh, I gave you my love in vain

Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
Cause there wasn't shit to do
We didn't know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
Our neighbor had a pool

We got green grass and a few trees
But it ain't like what's on TV

This is real life in the real world
We ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good, baby, but it's alright
Real life

We got a dive bar with a real band
They play too loud and they're real bad
But we're real bored so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems, but we do too
So we tip her anyway

That's just the way that it is
That's just the way that we live

This is real life in the real world
We ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good, baby, but it's alright
Real life
Yeah, we're lovin' real life

We find real love, get real hurt
Fall real hard, shake off the dirt
Pray to God, let's make a deal
I guess it just got real

Believe In Me,dan fogelberg,1984,1980,"If I could ever say it right
And reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor
Then you might
Come to believe in me
The life I lead is not the kind
That gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find
That you can believe in me
Those other loves that
Came before
Mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure
And will not believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real
If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real
If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Makes you believe in me
Oh, you can believe in me"
Blue Ribbon Baby,tommy s,1958,1950,"                Roxy Plays a Shrewd Trick
                 Whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is,
                knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam, the first
                great benefactor of our race. He brought death into the
                world. —Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar
        Percy Driscoll slept well the night he saved his house minions from going down the river, but no wink of sleep visited Roxy's eyes. A profound terror had taken possession of her. Her child could grow up and be sold down the river! The thought crazed her with horror. If she dozed and lost herself for a moment, the next moment she was on her feet flying to her child's cradle to see if it was still there. Then she would gather it to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy of kisses, moaning, crying, and saying, ""Dey sha'n't, oh, dey sha'nt'!'—yo' po' mammy will kill you fust!""
        Once, when she was tucking him back in its cradle again, the other child nestled in its sleep and attracted her attention. She went and stood over it a long time communing with herself.
        ""What has my po' baby done, dat he couldn't have yo' luck? He hain't done nuth'n. God was good to you; why warn't he good to him? Dey can't sell you down de river. I hates yo' pappy; he hain't got no heart—for niggers, he hain't, anyways. I hates him, en I could kill him!"" She paused awhile, thinking; then she burst into wild sobbings again, and turned away, saying, ""Oh, I got to kill my chile, dey ain't no yuther way—killin' him wouldn't save de chile fum goin' down de river. Oh, I got to do it, yo' po' mammy's got to kill you to save you, honey."" She gathered her baby to her bosom now, and began to smother it with caresses. ""Mammy's got to kill you—how kin I do it! But yo' mammy ain't gwine to desert you—no, no, dah, don't cry—she gwine wid you, she gwine to kill herself too. Come along, honey, come along wid mammy; we gwine to jump in de river, den troubles o' dis worl' is all over—dey don't sell po' niggers down the river over yonder.""
        She stared toward the door, crooning to the child and hushing it; midway she stopped, suddenly. She had caught sight of her new Sunday gown—a cheap curtain-calico thing, a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic figures. She surveyed it wistfully, longingly.
        ""Hain't ever wore it yet,"" she said, ""en it's just lovely."" Then she nodded her head in response to a pleasant idea, and added, ""No, I ain't gwine to be fished out, wid everybody lookin' at me, in dis mis'able ole linsey-woolsey.""
        She put down the child and made the change. She looked in the glass and was astonished at her beauty. She resolved to make her death toilet perfect. She took off her handkerchief turban and dressed her glossy wealth of hair ""like white folks""; she added some odds and ends of rather lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers; finally she threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a ""cloud"" in that day, which was of a blazing red complexion. Then she was ready for the tomb.
        She gathered up her baby once more; but when her eye fell upon its miserably short little gray tow-linen shirt and noted the contrast between its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic eruption of infernal splendors, her mother-heart was touched, and she was ashamed.
        ""No, dolling mammy ain't gwine to treat you so. De angels is gwine to 'mire you jist as much as dey does yo' mammy. Ain't gwine to have 'em putt'n dey han's up 'fo' dey eyes en sayin' to David and Goliah en dem yuther prophets, 'Dat chile is dress' to indelicate fo' dis place.'""
        By this time she had stripped off the shirt. Now she clothed the naked little creature in one of Thomas `a Becket's snowy, long baby gowns, with its bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles.
        ""Dah—now you's fixed."" She propped the child in a chair and stood off to inspect it. Straightway her eyes begun to widen with astonishment and admiration, and she clapped her hands and cried out, ""Why, it do beat all! I never knowed you was so lovely. Marse Tommy ain't a bit puttier—not a single bit.""
        She stepped over and glanced at the other infant; she flung a glance back at her own; then one more at the heir of the house. Now a strange light dawned in her eyes, and in a moment she was lost in thought. She seemed in a trance; when she came out of it, she muttered, ""When I 'uz a-washin' 'em in de tub, yistiddy, he own pappy asked me which of 'em was his'n.""
        She began to move around like one in a dream. She undressed Thomas `a Becket, stripping him of everything, and put the tow-linen shirt on him. She put his coral necklace on her own child's neck. Then she placed the children side by side, and after earnest inspection she muttered:
        ""Now who would b'lieve clo'es could do de like o' dat? Dog my cats if it ain't all I kin do to tell t' other fum which, let alone his pappy.""
        She put her cub in Tommy's elegant cradle and said:
        ""You's young Marse Tom fum dis out, en I got to practice and git used to 'memberin' to call you dat, honey, or I's gwine to make a mistake sometime en git us bofe into trouble. Dah—now you lay still en don't fret no mo', Marse Tom. Oh, thank de lord in heaven, you's saved, you's saved! Dey ain't no man kin ever sell mammy's po' little honey down de river now!""
        She put the heir of the house in her own child's unpainted pine cradle, and said, contemplating its slumbering form uneasily:
        ""I's sorry for you, honey; I's sorry, God knows I is—but what kin I do, what could I do? Yo' pappy would sell him to somebody, sometime, en den he'd go down de river, sho', en I couldn't, couldn't, couldn't stan' it.""
        She flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss, toss and think. By and by she sat suddenly upright, for a comforting thought had flown through her worried mind—
        ""'T ain't no sin—white folks has done it! It ain't no sin, glory to goodness it ain't no sin! Dey's done it—yes, en dey was de biggest quality in de whole bilin', too—kings!""
        She began to muse; she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim particulars of some tale she had heard some time or other. At last she said—
        ""Now I's got it; now I 'member. It was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole it, de time he come over here fum Illinois en preached in de nigger church. He said dey ain't nobody kin save his own self—can't do it by faith, can't do it by works, can't do it no way at all. Free grace is de on'y way, en dat don't come fum nobody but jis' de Lord; en he kin give it to anybody He please, saint or sinner—he don't kyer. He do jis' as He's a mineter. He s'lect out anybody dat suit Him, en put another one in his place, and make de fust one happy forever en leave t' other one to burn wid Satan. De preacher said it was jist like dey done in Englan' one time, long time ago. De queen she lef' her baby layin' aroun' one day, en went out callin'; an one 'o de niggers roun'bout de place dat was 'mos' white, she come in en see de chile layin' aroun', en tuck en put her own chile's clo's on de queen's chile, en put de queen's chile's clo'es on her own chile, en den lef' her own chile layin' aroun', en tuck en toted de queen's chile home to de nigger quarter, en nobody ever foun' it out, en her chile was de king bimeby, en sole de queen's chile down de river one time when dey had to settle up de estate. Dah, now—de preacher said it his own self, en it ain't no sin, 'ca'se white folks done it. DEY done it—yes, DEY done it; en not on'y jis' common white folks nuther, but de biggest quality dey is in de whole bilin'. Oh, I's so glad I 'member 'bout dat!""
        She got lighthearted and happy, and went to the cradles, and spent what was left of the night ""practicing."" She would give her own child a light pat and say humbly, ""Lay still, Marse Tom,"" then give the real Tom a pat and say with severity, ""Lay still, Chambers! Does you want me to take somep'n to you?""
        As she progressed with her practice, she was surprised to see how steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her manner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her speech and manner toward the usurper, and how similarly handy she was becoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of Driscoll.
        She took occasional rests from practicing, and absorbed herself in calculating her chances.
        ""Dey'll sell dese niggers today fo' stealin' de money, den dey'll buy some mo' dat don't now de chillen—so dat's all right. When I takes de chillen out to git de air, de minute I's roun' de corner I's gwine to gaum dey mouths all roun' wid jam, den dey can't nobody notice dey's changed. Yes, I gwine ter do dat till I's safe, if it's a year.
        ""Dey ain't but one man dat I's afeard of, en dat's dat Pudd'nhead Wilson. Dey calls him a pudd'nhead, en says he's a fool. My lan, dat man ain't no mo' fool den I is! He's de smartes' man in dis town, lessn' it's Jedge Driscoll or maybe Pem Howard. Blame dat man, he worries me wid dem ornery glasses o' his'n; I b'lieve he's a witch. But nemmine, I's gwine to happen aroun' dah one o' dese days en let on dat I reckon he wants to print a chillen's fingers ag'in; en if HE don't notice dey's changed, I bound dey ain't nobody gwine to notice it, en den I's safe, sho'. But I reckon I'll tote along a hoss-shoe to keep off de witch work.""
        The new Negros gave Roxy no trouble, of course. The master gave her none, for one of his speculations was in jeopardy, and his mind was so occupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them, and all Roxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came about; then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums, and he was gone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a human aspect.
        Within a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that Mr. Percy went away with his brother, the judge, to see what could be done with it. It was a land speculation as usual, and it had gotten complicated with a lawsuit. The men were gone seven weeks. Before they got back, Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson, and was satisfied. Wilson took the fingerprints, labeled them with the names and with the date —October the first—put them carefully away, and continued his chat with Roxy, who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in flesh and beauty which the babes had made since he took their fingerprints a month before. He complimented their improvement to her contentment; and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain, she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any moment he—
        But he didn't. He discovered nothing; and she went home jubilant, and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind."

You got a way of drawing attention to you
You know you stand out in a crowd
But the way that you play
With any man's affections
Should never be allowed
See I consider myself
The one who will show you
I'd go as far as to say
Girl, I ain't leaving here without you
But you better understand
There's only one rule in this game we're going to play
And that's reaction to action
Maybe like a word that would thrill me
I need reaction to action
One look that would kill me
Give me reaction to action
It's getting late I'd better make a definite move
Reaction to action

Hangin' from a snake's mouth comin' out a pyramid

Dirty mountain tiger to the face
Better strap up, I'm 'bout to see space
As I entered, I felt everything was centered

In the parking lot of Queens Center, uh (Don't hurt me baby)
My grandparents learned English watchin' Martin, uh, ha yeah

Oh I'd run all the way back home
Sing me away

Reach,orleans,1977,1970,"Sometimes
I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful places I've been
My arms around the future
And I can think about the past
My aspirations always exceed
My grasp
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey
Whoa whoa
You've got to grow
Sometimes
Know that you've got to reach
A little bit higher (little bit higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old
Mmm no no no
When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
No no
Well you may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you (come to you)
And say these same words again (yeah again again again yeah yeah yeah)
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow
Sometimes I sit myself down and I say
You got to reach (you got to reach)
A little bit higher (higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul (oh)
And you'll never grow old
Never never never grow old

Come As You Are,peter wolf,1987,1980,"They hung a sign out, sign out after seven
Down at the hive where you're such a busy bee
So sign in honey, sign up for heaven
Just you tonight, it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
There'll be a high time, high time at the lakeside
Barry and the boys are going in for free
We'll jump the moon, take it for a joyride
I stuck it up there for you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
I'm just a bluebird, bluebird at your window
And it's for sure, you're a pretty sight to see
But life's so short and I know what you're into
Come it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball

Sexy Eyes,dr. hook,1980,1980,"I was sitting all alone, watching people getting off, with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes

Along Comes A Woman,chicago,1985,1980,"There is a time when a man needs someone to talk to
Someone to talk to, somebody who'll always be there
All alone, nothing seemed to matter
So alone, doesn't get much better
Can't explain something that you're feeling
For the very first time

There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere
All alone, suddenly you see her
So alone, you know you're gonna need her
Can't explain something that you're feeling
For the very first time

Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right

There was a time when you needed someone to count on
You needed someone to count on
Someone to care
Now she's here, nothing seems to matter
She's so near, everything is better
Can't explain, something that you're feeling
For the very first time

Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the air that you're breathing tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right


Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight

Cruel Summer,bananarama,1984,1980,"Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around
Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone


It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer

Broken Hearted Me,anne murray,1979,1970,"Every now and then I cry
Every night, you keep staying on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me

Every day is just the same
Playing games, different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted
Time won't heal a broken hearted me"
One And Only Man,steve winwood,1990,1990,"Every time I see you
Girl, it makes me feel so sad
Knowing you've been seeing
Some other guy that treats you bad
You know that I'm burning
Deep inside for you
Just give me the chance now
And we can see it through
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Gonna take me with you
Far away from hearts of stone
We'll live in the country
And raise some children of our own
I will be your lover
I will be your friend
I'll give you all my loving
On that you can depend
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
Take you to the city
Girl, we're gonna buy some clothes
Dress you up so pretty
Then we'll take in all the shows
Find a place that's jumping
Where the music's tight
And we'll keep on dancing till the morning light
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Be my woman, I'll be your man
Know I'm gonna give you everything I can
Be my woman, I'll be your man
There'll be no more running, gonna make a stand"
Read 'Em And Weep,barry manilow,1984,1980,"I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or a fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you gave up and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
Well, I could tell you ""goodbye"" or maybe ""see you around""
With just a touch of a sarcastic ""thanks""
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
I've been whispering softly trying to build a cry up into a scream
We let the past slip away and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed-out dream
And I've been dreaming forever, hoping something would eventually come
I saw your eyes in the dark, I felt your kiss on my lips
I traced your body in the air until the bodies were numb
Well, I could tell you ""goodbye"" or maybe ""see you around""
With just a touch of a sarcastic ""thanks""
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's fine
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
Oh, it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
Oh, it's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
(Read 'em and weep) For all the hours we'll be spending alone
(Read 'em and weep) For the dreams we'll ignore
(Running silent and deep) And all those promises we promised to keep
They won't be kept anymore
(Read 'em and weep) For the magic that our bodies had made
(Read 'em and weep) For the blood that we've lost
(Running silent and deep) And all those secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost
(Read 'em and weep) For the memories still alive in the bed
(Read 'em and weep) For the lies we believed
(Running silent and deep) And all the things that will have never been said
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
Come on and look at me and read 'em
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's there in my eyes, it's all I can say
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep"
"Sweet Freedom (Theme From ""Running Scared"")",michael mcdonald,1986,1980,"No more runnin' down the wrong road

Pussy Cat,the ames brothers,1958,1950,"The movie opens in flashback to about 1980 at a fair in Indiana of some sort. With pie eating contests...
OLD LADY: On the count of three. One, two, three!
...ring toss...
ANNOUNCER: Try the ring toss. Three for a quarter. Look how easy it is. There you go, a winner!
...and eventually the one the camera settles, on a boy magician named ""Harold the Great"", who is about to perform a trick, where an assistant saws a girl in a box in half with a chainsaw.
HAROLD: And now, for my shocking finale. Not for the squeamish. Not for the faint of heart. I call my trick ""The Jaws of Death. ""
He turns to the girl in the box.
HAROLD: Now. Say it. Say it.
GIRL: Harold, use your awesome might to save me from this hopeless plight.
He waves a wand on her.
HAROLD: No harm will come to you. Alakazam.
Midway through the sawing, the girl lets loose with a series of piercing screams.
GIRL:Help me! Help me!
The audience panics, and some nearby adults rush up and open the box. The girl is just pretending to be hurt and smiles up at an adult man...
GIRL:I'm going to be an actress.
The adult slaps her.
OPENING CREDITSDay One: Trouble is my businessThe movie cuts to a generic Hollywood beautiful person party where we see Harry (Robert Downey Jr.), fully but shabbily clothed, intentionally teetering at the edge of a pool full of bikini clad women.
HARRY (V.O.): Hard to believe it was last Christmas that me and Harmony changed the world.  And we didn't mean to. And it didn't last long, you know. A thing like that can't.Now that I'm in L.A., I go to parties. The kind where if a girl is named Jill, she spells it J-Y-L-L-E, that bullshit.
At this point the camera focuses on Harry, who finally introduces himself as the narrator.
HARRY (V.O.): That's me there. My name's Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator.  Welcome to L.A. Welcome to the party.
Close on two guys talking, a Larry Miller-ish casting agent (played by - who else - Larry Miller)...
HARRY (V.O.): The guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw, my producer. He discovered me.
...and another, played by Val Kilmer.
HARRY (V.O.): The man with him is Perry Van Shrike, a.k.a. Gay Perry. Honest-to-God private eye, consults in film, TV. Just incorporated. He's bigtime. Also, he's gay.
SHAW: Don't start, Perry, huh?  I seen you play ball. You're tough. But you see a naked guy, your brain says, ""I want that. "" I don't make that leap. It's like, ""Look, there's an elephant. Quick, let's drain its blood to paint my boathouse. "" It's just that that's not the first thing you think of.
Perry laughs. Back to Harry, who’s lighting a cigarette.
HARRY (V.O.): L.A. By now you may wonder how I wound up here, or maybe not. Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty picks shit up from comic books. Point is, I don't see another goddamn narrator, so pipe down. How did I get here? See for yourself.
How Harry got to the party
We now cut to New York City, and then specifically to a small toy store late at night. It’s obviously closed, and we hear Harry on the phone with his niece.
HARRY (offscreen): Chloe, just run the name by me one more time because I must be missing something.
HARRY: I'm going nuts. I've been through the store three times.
CHLOE: Cyber Agent. C-Y-B-E- Why don't you ask an employee or something?
HARRY: No, they're all busy.
HARRY: Ah! ""Protocop, protector of man. "" Is that it? Protocop? He protects men.
CHLOE: Uncle Harry, look around. There are signs.
CHLOE:  That show was cancelled two years ago. Just ask- Wait, are they even open?
HARRY:Yeah, it's holiday hours. Look-  Get away from the window.  I gotta go, but I'll find this.
A large UPS truck drives by, jostling the wiring on the jury rigged alarm and setting it off.
HARRY:Great.
The two run out the back door and into an alley.
PARTNER:  Shit, Harry, that shit went wrong!
HARRY:Give me the gun!
PARTNER: No. Give me the bullets!
WOMAN (O.S.): Freeze!
As they turn around and lift their hands, the camera pans up, revealing a woman on a fire escape with a pistol.
HARRY:You gotta be fucking kidding me.
WOMAN WITH GUN: We'll stand here and wait for the police.
HARRY:Drop the gun. We didn't do anything. We are not dangerous. Drop the gun.
PARTNER:Hey, lady, gun is not loaded-
HARRY:Richie, no!
They are fired upon by the woman . Harry's partner is hit by a bullet that grazed Harry’s arm.
HARRY:Richie!  Shit!
Harry escapes on foot. The police approaches, he’s forced to turn around and take another way.
HARRY:Oh, boy.
WOMAN: Take it easy. Jesus. Oh, no, no. We're not ready for you yet, sir.Go wait with the others.
SHAW:  Grace, do me a favor, let's take him. He's ready. You're ready?
GRACE: Ready?
HARRY:Okay, come on.
GRACE: You know the setup? Got any questions?
SHAW: He's got no questions. Look at him. Let's go.
HARRY:Let's read.
GRACE:  Where is he? Where's Raphael?
HARRY:Where is he? Where's-?
HARRY:  Beat up on me all night. You want me to give up my partner, you can go spit.
GRACE: Quit acting like the good guy, jerk-off. You got your partner killed. He was in over his head, you knew it. You may as well have pulled the trigger. You killed him!
HARRY: No, I didn't- I didn't kill him. He wanted in. Why-? Why?! I didn't want him to come in on it. He insisted. I said, ""Stay at home. "" But he doesn't listen. He's such a stupid son of a bitch. I killed him, didn't I? Oh, fuck, this is my fault.
COP: I'm sorry. Sorry. Hey, good luck.
SHAW: See, this is what I'm talking about. Old school. Method.
GRACE: Studio.
SHAW: Brando. Put this in the pouch to L.A. Get Gay Perry on the phone.
Meanwhile, back at the party…
HARRY (V.O.): Now, get this, they're screen-testing me. Is that wild? One minute, I'm boosting Xboxes in the East Village the next, I'm sipping champagne in L.A.
A blonde approaches Harry.
BLONDE: Hi.
HARRY:  Hey.
BLONDE: So, what do you do?
HARRY: I'm retired. I invented dice when I was a kid. How about you?
BLONDE: I do a little acting.
BLONDE: I'm gonna see who else is here.
HARRY (V.O.): Anyway, that's how I got to the party.
A woman (Michelle Monaghan)  is introduced by the narrator.
HARRY (V.O.): Now, Harmony, different story. Some will tell you she got here on account of the giant robot.  I'll show you that in a minute. But for me, robot-schmobot, she was destined to be here. Jeez, look at those stems, will you? Not that that's what constitutes why she should be here.
HARMONY: Yes, racist. I'm serious.  The other reindeer laughed at him. Then, out of the blue, they need him.  He's as good as a fog light or whatever. You know what, so you tell me, how is it any different than: ""Don't talk to Reggie, he's black. Oh, wait, he can play basketball.
Sign him up. "" Rudolph, Reggie.
How Harmony got to the party
Images of a Middle-American town.
HARRY (V.O.): Harmony Faith Lane was your typical L.A. girl, she wasn't from there. She grew up in a burg in southern Indiana.  ""When in doubt, cut up a pig. "" That was the town motto.  Like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls, Harmony was wicked smart. Of course, credit where credit's due she had a terrific mentor.  No, not her.
 Him.
CHILD HARMONY: ""'Go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!' She poured herself into a seamless dress. From the looks of it, she spilled some. ""
HARRY (V.O.): Jonny spoke from the pages of cheap paperbacks and told of a promised land known as ""the Coast” and a magical city called Los Angeles. As the years progressed, she wished he was real. Wished that he would come to Indiana to save her little sister, Jenna.
HARRY (V.O.):You see, Papa was at her night after night. But Jonny never showed. And then the guy writing the books died. Age 16, she split.
HARRY (V.O.): Took the bus to L.A., the promised land. She'd get rich and famous and then help little sis. Before he died the guy who wrote the books said Jonny was a joke. He wrote it for money, and it was bullshit. Harmony ignored this. She knew better. I mean, who the hell was he?  He was just a writer.  And that's how she got to the same party as me-
HARRY (V.O.): Oh, shit. I skipped something. Damn it. This robot bit. I made a big deal, then I forgot. Fuck, bad narrating. Like my dad telling a joke. ""Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you the cowboy rode a blue horse."" Fuck.  I don't know if you want to see it now, but here's the fucking robot stuff. Can I say ""fuck"" more?
ANNOUNCER: Now back to Protocop, starring Jeff Neal.
HARMONY: What the-? Oh, my God.
HARMONY: Hey!
REPORTER (V.O.): Sources close to Neal, who has not worked as an actor in two years say he seemed despondent earlier tonight during a rerun of Protocop.
REPORTER: The actor, who still retains a costume he wore on the show, allegedly dressed up, stumbled down the bike path and wandered into this Venice Beach house…
REPORTER (V.O.): … where aspiring actress Harmony Faith Lane was shocked to discover him.
HARMONY: I'd jog by, ""Hi, hello, "" you know, that sort of thing.
SHAW: Who's this?
HARMONY: I feel for the guy. This city can't get enough of messing with people. Like putting a whoopee cushion on the seat of an electric chair. Like that.
SHAW: They always do this.You can never see below the waist. It's like a Playmate in 1964. It was always behind the bedpost or there's a shadow. You never-What am I telling you for? Invite her to something.
Back to the present.
HARRY (V.O.): And there it was. Bingo. Destiny.
Harmony is seen going over the bookshelves in the house until she finds some copies of the same old paperback detective series - ""Johnny Gossamer"". She hugs them tenderly, reads from them for a bit and then passes out on a table. A sleazy man enters and, seeing her unconscious - starts to poke around in her underthings before Harry walks in.
HARRY: You know what, you better be her doctor. Walk away. Don't think, just do it.
SLEAZE: What, are you her brother or something? It's none of your business, man. I will fuck you up.
HARRY:  No, you'll try. And that little experimente will end in tears, my friend.So again, for the cheap seats, do not think, walk the fuck away.Or let's you and me go outside right now.It's past my bedtime. Make a choice.
Harry ends up being beaten to a pulp - reflecting he never was very good at fighting.
SLEAZE: Asshole.
PERRY:  You all right?
HARRY:    Yeah.
Thanks, bro. One day, I'll actually learn how to fight.
PERRY: Perry Van Shrike.
HARRY:   Hey. Harry Lockhart.
HARRY:   I heard about you. You're the whatchamacallit, the consultant. You must be- Anyway...
PERRY: Gay Perry?
HARRY:  Yeah. Right. Dabney calls you that.I guess you guys are old buddies.
PERRY:  Five years now.
HARRY:   Wow, five years. Still gay?
PERRY: Me? No. I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the name so much, I can't get rid of it.
SLEAZE:  You should know better than to fall asleep at a party. There's freaks here.
PERRY: Dabney wants you to take detective lessons.
HARRY:    Come again?
PERRY: For your acting. I've got surveillance tomorrow. You game?
HARRY:   What's the person like? Crime lord?
PERRY: Please. I'm guessing some sad, lonely little man who single-handedly haunts his own home in the Hollywood Hills.
HARRY:   That was incredibly gay.
HARLAN: Good God. Ouch.
HARRY: Yeah, you should see the other guy.
PERRY: Harry, this is our generous host, Harlan Dexter.
HARLAN: Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's golden boy from back East. I hope it isn't past your bedtime.
HARRY: No, sir. My mom used to say I had the neon disease. When the neon lights came on, I woke up.
HARLAN:I'm afraid I'm similarly afflicted. My daughter just lived 10 years in Paris. She says it is heaven for the vampire set.
HARLAN:If you'll excuse me, apparently I'm meant to help cut this monstrosity.
PERRY:Mom's gone, so it's just him and his born-again little bundle of joy.
HARRY: Born-again? That's precious.
PERRY:Isn't it? Three months ago, she was suing him over Mom's millions.  He called her a- Well, a bad word. Cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.
HARRY (V.O.): Okay, I apologize. That is a terrible scene. It's like, ""Why was that in the movie?   Gee, you think maybe it'll come back later, maybe?"" I hate that. A TV's on, talking about the new power plant. Wonder where the climax will happen. Or that shot of the cook in Hunt for Red October. Sorry.
RECEPTIONIST: Hi, thank you for coming.
HARRY: Hey, do you know that blond gal who just left?
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, the one with the guy that beat the shit out of you? No. Bye, have a better night.
HARRY: She had something, that gal, this quality. Like the girl from high school, the one that got away. You know what I mean? That haunts you still.
PERRY:Yeah, I had that.
HARRY:  You did?
PERRY: Bobby Mills.
HARRY:  Huh. Well, maybe you should try to get in touch. I got 5 bucks says you could still get him.
PERRY: Really? That's funny. I got a 10 says, ""Pass the pepper.""  I got two quarters harmonizing on ""Moonlight in Vermont. ""
HARRY:  What?
PERRY: Talking money.
HARRY:  A talking monkey?
PERRY: Talking monkey, yeah.Came here from the future. Ugly sucker. Only says, ""Ficus. "" Detective lessons tomorrow.Don't forget.
HARRY:  Okay.
PERRY: And Harry... Come here.  That girl, I know her. She's done some work for me.Try the Domino Room.
HARRY:  Where's that?
FLICKA: Hey there. I'm Flicka.
HARRY:  Hey. How are you?
FLICKA:  Good. So, what do you do?
HARRY:  I'm a private detective. And you?
FLICKA:  I'm a stewardess.
HARRY: Really?
FLICKA:  Yeah. Well, nice to meet you.
HARRY:  That it?
FLICKA:  Yeah.
HARRY:   Yep.
HARRY:  Could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks.  Evening. Harry. God, I'm sore. I mean, physically, not like a guy who's angry in a movie in the 1950s.Didn't I see you at a party hours ago?
HARMONY: Why?
HARRY:   Why what?
HARMONY: Why me? Seriously, why not the girl over there? Look, she's very pretty.
HARRY:   Which one?
HARMONY: On the left, next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.
HARRY:  Oh, that's a bit of a reach. I'm interrupting. I feel badly. What are you drinking?
HARMONY: Bad.
HARRY: Bad? Sorry?
HARMONY: You feel bad.
HARRY:   Bad?
HARMONY: ""Badly"" is an adverb. To say you feel badly says that the mechanism which allows you to feel is broken.
HARRY:   Well, that one over there?
HARMONY: Between- Oh, God, nix, nix. That's-  The blond. The blond's pathetic.
HARRY:   Because?
HARMONY: For starters, she's been fucked more times than she's had hot meals.
HARRY:  I heard. It was neck and neck, and then she skipped lunch.
HARMONY:  Worst thing, though....
HARRY:   Do tell.
HARMONY: Worst thing is she's 35 years old and still trying to act. I see her at auditions all the time. It's over, baby. You missed.
HARRY:   That's charitable of you.May I ask how old you are?
HARMONY:  Go for it.
HARRY:   Okay, how old are you?
HARMONY:  Thirty-four.
HARRY:   Yeah?
HARMONY:   I'm a baby.
HARRY:   Where's your buddy? The guy you- The guy you left the party with?
HARMONY:   He's a fucking asshole. I just needed a ride.Sorry, I swear a lot.
HARRY:   I know. It's okay.
HARMONY:   Did you know the host?
HARRY:   No.
HARMONY:   He looked familiar, though.  Probably an actor.
HARMONY’S FRIEND: Buzz buzz. Go away, Mr. Fly.
HARRY:   I was talking to your friend.
HARMONY’S FRIEND: She doesn't want to talk to you.
HARRY:  Sunshine, she'll be back to you in a minute. Relax.
HARMONY’S FRIEND: She doesn't have a minute.
HARRY:   Tell you what, if you change your mind about that drink, I'll be over there with Native American Joe Pesci.
HARMONY: You are so....
HARRY:  That was good, right?
HARMONY’S FRIEND: Why are you humoring him? Stop it. You know what, there's an empty table over there. I hear it's a recommended cheeseball hangout.
HARRY:Your mouth is a recommended place to put a sock. Princess. Scary friend.
HARMONY:  Goddamn it.Harry Lockhart, are you gonna recognize me or what? God! Embrey, Indiana! Loves snakes, afraid of spiders. Come on, remember? You were Amazing Harry- No, no, no. Harold the Great.
HARRY:Harmony?
HARMONY:  You cut me in half, remember?
HARMONY’S FRIEND: Harmony…
HARRY: Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?
HARRY (V.O.): Okay, I was a bad narrator again...
...because the kid at the beginning, the magician, that was me. I don't want to put this on you... but if you've been paying attention, I shouldn't have to-
Great. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle. I got an idea. Why not put these two lame-o extras in front of the mammoth fucking lens? Boo.
Scat. Fat lady, leave.
See there? ""Harold. ""

HARRY (V.O.): Remember how I said this high school chick haunted me? How seeing Harmony made me think of her? That's because it was her.  It all came flooding back. How I was the one she confided in.  While she was doing every other guy in school. 
HARRY (V.O.): It was the first time I felt that how pitying someone and wanting to fuck them can get all tangled up in your head. Overwhelming sadness. Meanwhile, you got a rodney.Is that sick? I think- Yeah, I think that's sick.
Back to the present.
HARMONY: Leaving my sister back home, leaving her there all alone....Hardest thing I ever did.Do you remember when we were real little and a movie crew came to town?
HARRY: That mystery flick with the guy, Jonny what's-his-name?
HARMONY:  Gossamer.
HARRY: Jonny Gossamer. Right. Your mom went nuts, and she bought all the books and stuff.
HARMONY:  That was- God, that was forever ago.
HARRY: Yeah, that was back in the day.
HARMONY: Harry... I didn't get famous.
HARRY: Yet.
HARMONY: I did... get to do this one commercial.
HARRY: You're shitting me. Which one?
HARMONY: Well, you know the one with the bear? And it goes- Well, this is funny.  ""I prefer Genaros, but-""
HARRY: ""But I'm a bear, what do I know? I suck heads off fish. "" That was you?  Oh, my God.
HARMONY:  Yeah, it was. Yeah.
HARRY: That's awesome.
HARMONY:  Oooh, Commercial.
HARRY:Come on, that's a big deal. That's a national commercial.
HARMONY:  Harry, stop. It's nothing. There was actually this kind of cool moment where I got to sort of do the wave. ""I prefer Genaros. "" Whatever, it's nothing.
HARRY: It's pretty cool.
HARMONY: It's nothing special at all.
HARRY:    Well, I think it's special.  Punk-rock Steven Seagal thinks it's special. Right there, at your 11 o'clock.  That's dead-on, right? That's all right. I had him pegged when I came in.Come back to the hotel for a little while, just have one drink. Bring your friend. It'd just be a drink. You'll be home faster than you can say ""Jack Robinson. ""
HARMONY: I don't know about that. I can say ""Jack Robinson"" pretty fast.
HARRY:    I'm timing you.
HARMONY:  Jack Robinson.
Cut to: Bedroom, next day
Two champagne glasses, and then Harry waking up with a girl in his bed... He thinks it's Harmony, but is shocked to find out it's her hostile friend instead. She comes towards him with a smile on his face, but he jumps out of bed.   Harry runs to Harmony's place and knocks on her door.
HARMONY: Do you have any idea what time it is?
HARRY:    I'm really sorry. God, you still look great. You're just stunning. I like-
HARMONY:  Why are you here?
HARRY:    Good question. Sounds crazy, but I don't remember what occurred...between the hours of 2 and 5, a blur.
HARMONY: Really? Where's Marleah?
HARRY:    Marleah?
HARMONY: The girl you....
HARRY:    Marleah fell asleep at my place and I didn't see you leave-
HARMONY: I left when you had your tongue down her throat.
HARRY:   I did?
HARMONY: Yeah.
HARRY:   God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman. That's bad.
HARMONY: Yeah, that's bad. You got 10 seconds, Harry.
HARRY:    Oh, boy, pressure, pressure. I came here... because I think you're intelligent and attractive-
HARMONY:That's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God! I can't believe you'd come here to tell me you like me after you fucked my friend!
HARRY:   That's just it, I didn't. I believe that I did not.
HARMONY: What? You said you don't remember!
HARRY:    If I don't remember because I was drunk, how could I have gotten it up? I know this is outrageous and not normal. I'm not pretending that I'm normal. I just chickened out-
HARRY:   Moron. Why? Why? Why?
Day two: The Lady in the LakeHARRY (V.O.):And the plots, they all have this thing, this formula that was so cool.
HARRY: Seriously, I would go through one in a day.
PERRY:  A whole book in one day. Wow.
HARRY:See, Gossamer would always take on two cases that were seemingly unrelated.  One's normal and the other's some wild shit... then you'd find out that they're connected. That it's all one case. That's the essence of the-
PERRY: Yeah, I get that all the time. Would you mind not rooting around in there?
HARRY: It's tiny. Is this real?
PERRY: Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded. I call it my faggot gun.
HARRY: Because?
PERRY:  It's only good for a couple shots, then you gotta drop it for something better.   You asked, chief.  On with our lesson.
PERRY:  My client is one Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.
HARRY: Ames.
PERRY: Female. She hired me to do some video surveillance.
HARRY: Is she a looker?
PERRY: Oh, man. She opens the door, she got nothing on but the radio. Invites me to sit down, sits on my lap... fires up a smoke.
HARRY: Really?
PERRY:  No. Idiot. She hired me over the phone.Paid for it with a credit card.
HARRY: Okay.
PERRY:  Rule number one: This business, real life, it's boring. Do you have to smoke?
HARRY: You want me to put it out?
PERRY: Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.
They are approaching a woodsy house
PERRY: So you knew Harmony in high school. You said she dissed you.
HARRY: No, not really. She fucked every other guy but me. No, that's not true. She made one concession.  She agreed not to fuck my best friend, Chook Chutney. He was my best friend, so she gave me that.
PERRY: Well, that was nice of her.
HARRY: Even if he asked, she said she wouldn't.
PERRY: Stay put. Be quiet.
They hide behind a woodpile with a video camera .
PERRY:""Chook Chutney""? Yeah, he's gay.
Perry comes close to the cottage with a camera, walks back once someone comes out of the house in a ski mask, gets in an old beater car and drives off.
HARRY: What's wrong with his car?
PERRY: Do I look like a mechanic? Come on.
Harry and Perry follow them by car.
HARRY:  Are we gonna follow him? Where'd he go? He was right in front of us, then he cut in- Where is he?
They seem to lose him and stop by a pond next to a low ridge to get their bearings
HARRY: What the hell. He's gotta be somewhere. He turned right in front of us.
As they look around, the beater car comes shooting airborne over the ridge and lands in the pond.
HARRY: Ow!
PERRY: Jesus!
They quickly leave the car
Harry Shit!
Harry rushes towards the pond.
PERRY: Harry, come back. Harry. There's no one in the car. Harry.
HARRY:  What?
Harry is now waist-deep in the water
PERRY: Harry, stop.
Harry turns around.
HARRY: I think it's going down.
PERRY:  Wait, the sound.
He points to the car
HARRY:  Check the back seat.
PERRY:  No, get the keys! The keys! Get the keys!
Perry dives into the water.
HARRY: Perry. Perry? Shit. Perry!
Perry emerges holding a body. It's a woman in a sundress.
PERRY: Watch out.
HARRY: Where'd she come from?
PERRY: She was in the trunk. I had to shoot the lock to get it open. Oh, Jesus.
Harry gets her legs so both can leave the body on the sand.
PERRY:  God, what did they do to her face?
Both lie down for a while, recovering their breaths.
HARRY: Is she dead?
PERRY:  No. She's resting her eyes for a minute. Of course she's fucking dead. Her neck's broken.
Harry notices she has no underwear, pulls her skirt down to cover the “parts”. A car breaking is heard. Harry then points up, Perry turns and sees two figures in ski masks appear on top of the ridge.
HARRY: Hey, what the hell's going on?
PERRY:   Shut up.
HARRY: Hey, we got a dead girl here!
PERRY:  Hey, shut up.
The masked guys return to their car.
HARRY: Two guys in masks, and there they go.
PERRY:  What the fuck is going on?
HARRY:  This is bad. We gotta roll before the cops come.
PERRY:  Nix. We go right to the cops.
HARRY:  Exactly, to the cops who'll believe that she broke her neck before you shot her in the head.
PERRY: What?
Perry checks the corpse’s face, she has a huge gunshot wound above one eye.
HARRY:   Come on, we gotta go.
PERRY:  Oh, God.
Harry picks up Perry’s briefcase and gun
HARRY:    We gotta go. Go, go, go.
PERRY:  Oh, God. Oh, God.
Harry throws the gun in the lake
HARRY:     All right, we're out of here.
PERRY:   We gotta go, go, go.
PERRY: Where's my gun?
HARRY:   No, I-
PERRY:  Give me my gun.
HARRY:  I got rid of it.
PERRY:  Say again.
HARRY:Threw it in the lake. You wouldn't, I would.I got priors in New York, so I can't be messing around-
PERRY:  You threw it away?
HARRY: It's evidence. Watch it. Relax.
PERRY:   Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry. I got a little nonplussed there.
HARRY: This is crazy. I understand.
PERRY: Whoa! What is that? Is that a clue?
HARRY: What do you mean?
PERRY: Do you see that?
HARRY: In the thing?
PERRY: What were you thinking? My $2000 ceramic Vektor my mother got me as a special gift you threw next to the car. What happens when they drag the lake? You think they'll find my pistol? Jesus. Look up ""idiot"" in the dictionary. You know what you'll find?
HARRY:  A picture of me?
PERRY:  No, the definition of the word ""idiot,"" which you fucking are.

PERRY (O.S.): Bitch client.
PERRY: Hires me, has me witness a murder.
HARRY: Can I use a dry towel? This towel's wet.
PERRY: No.
HARRY: This towel is wet.
PERRY: The towel is for the seat.
HARRY: This was for your shoes. You handed it to me for my face? This is wet. Can I use a dry-?
PERRY: It's dirty. No.
HARRY: Can I-?
PERRY: No. Stop dripping. Shit better be improving your acting.
PERRY: Get out.
HARRY: Sorry about the gun.
PERRY: Whatever. Out. Go. Sleep badly. Any questions, hesitate to call.
HARRY:  Bad.
PERRY:  Excuse me?
HARRY: Sleep bad. Otherwise, it seems like the mechanism that allows sleep-
PERRY: What, fuckhead? ""Badly"" is an adverb. Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.
HARRY:  I'll give you a buzz.
PERRY:  Die.
After Harry is dropped off and is walking away, Perry returns.
HARRY:  That's all right, don't apologize.
PERRY: Blow me. You forgot this.
HARRY:  Oh, thanks.  Hello?
MAN ON PHONE: I'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.
HARRY:  Speaking.
MAN ON PHONE: I'm detective Sgt. Kale.  Mind answering a question or two?
HARRY: Of course, no problem. Fire away, officer.
KALE: Thank you.   Are you familiar with a woman by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?
HARRY:  Yeah, what's this-?
KALE: Are you aware of giving your number to Miss Lane recently? On a slip of paper, perhaps?
HARRY:  No.
KALE: Are you sure?
HARRY:  Well, maybe she had my number. Why?
KALE: We're required by law to treat every suicide as a potential homicide. Harmony Lane shot herself, sir.
HARRY:  Suicide?
KALE: Yes-
HARRY: Hello?  Hello?
HARRY: I'll be goddamned.
PERRY:  Jesus.
PERRY: Don't blame yourself. Listen... sometimes these things just happen-
HARRY: For a reason.For a reason? Fuck that.Why? Because I fall off a building, 10 people in Baltimor survive a bus crash? Swell, they're enjoying Baltimore. I'm lying here with my brains out.
PERRY: I've been to Baltimore, you win. Listen... I'm really sorry. I gotta go.
HARRY:  Yeah.
PERRY:  I gotta go.  I have to go.
With Harry no longer touching his car, Perry drives away
A television playing Harmony’s commercial. She’s dressed as an European milkmaid in a castle full of people in German costumes. A cheesy CGI bear comes out of a cake carrying bottles of beer, leading Harmony to wave. The bear throws the bottles to the people there, who proceed to dance and party. As shots of beer being poured into a glass are shown, we hear the announcer.
ANNOUNCER: Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.
Cut to the bear in front of Harmony, who just keeps laughing.
BEAR: I prefer Genaros. But what do I know? I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.
The bear shows a fish in his paw, puts it in his mouth and removes it decapitated. Harmony turns to the camera and laughs one more time as the announcer says “Genaros”.
A heartbroken Harry enters his hotel room.
HARRY (V.O.): I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club.  I needed a hot bath, a warm bed. 
HARRY (V.O.):But the night had other plans for me.
HARRY:  Oh, you did?
CHLOE:   I got the Cyber Agent.
HARRY:  You got the Cyber Agent.
CHLOE:  It has all the cool weapons.
HARRY:  You got Protocop coming too. It's gonna be worth more too because I think he's, like, paralyzed now.
HARRY:  Son of a bitch!
HARRY (V.O.): See, I forgot, old Jonny, he always had two cases. Remember?
HARRY: How are you?
HARMONY: Hey. She's gone, Harry.
HARRY:  Yeah.
HARMONY: She's gone.
HARRY:  I know. Who?

COP: Fact is, she stole not only your credit card, but your ID. We're very sorry about the mix-up on our part.
COP (O.S.): So are you willing to positively identify this woman as your-
Back to Harry’s apartment, where Harmony is smoking, screaming, and running back and forth.
HARMONY: My sister!
HARRY:  Your sister was here?
HARMONY: Yes!Oh, God! God, we haven't spoken in years. She's never forgiven me for leaving her all alone.
HARRY:  Fine. I'm just gonna get you a blanket.
HARMONY: I don't want a blanket!
HARRY:  But you're shivering.
HARMONY: I don't care!
HARRY:  You're freaking me out. Will you relax, okay?
HARMONY: Oh, God.
HARRY:  I'm so glad that you're okay, but now, I don't know, you're making me more nervous. Sit down.
HARMONY:  Okay.
HARRY:  Tell me what happened.
HARMONY: Yesterday, Jenna, she got into my house, Harry. She must have been broke, I don't know. She swiped 200 bucks, a credit card, California ID, God knows what else.
HARRY:  Right.
HARMONY:  Oh, God. No more lies, Harry.
HARRY: No.  No.
HARMONY: Are you a detective?  Are you a detective?
HARRY:  Who told you that? 
HARMONY: Flicka. Flicka. You know, my friend? She told me. She told me you were a detective. If you are, then I really need your help.
HARRY:  Well-
HARRY: That's empty, honey.
HARMONY: Okay, I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.My sister's been living out here....
HARRY (V.O.): Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell? What was she even doing here? The lady in the lake, now the sister.This was two corpses in three hours. Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?Yeah, looking back, I maybe should've told her...
HARRY (V.O.):...I wasn't really a nipple- Detective. Detective. Sorry. I should've said something, but she wouldn't shut up.
HARMONY: The card she stole from me was maxed out! Right before she died, she charged over $2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it? Sentron something. Some bullshit company! Plus- Red flag, Harry. She took her birth control pill for the day. Why would she even bother with the pill, huh? She was murdered, Harry. She was murdered. She was murdered.
HARRY:  Honey, all right. Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.
HARMONY: Are you gonna help me, Harry?
(She gets her face close to Harry’s)
HARRY:   I gotta check my schedule-
HARMONY:  If you're not gonna help me... I need to get out of here, find someone that'll help me.
HARRY:   I just gotta check my schedule.
HARMONY: Can you help me? If you're not gonna help me, I need to find somebody else!
HARRY:   My caseload is pretty-
HARMONY: Oh, Harry, thank you.
HARRY:   Yuck, come on.
HARRY:It was nothing. I didn't do anything.
HARMONY: What are you doing?
HARRY:I didn't do anything.
HARMONY: You were grabbing my tit.
HARRY:No, there was a spider. There was a big spider.
HARMONY:  Oh, please, whatever.
HARRY:  I swear to God.
HARRY: Look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing. Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.
HARMONY:  Whatever. It's okay, I believe you.
HARRY: Clearly, you don't.
HARMONY: Look, Harry, you grabbed my tit. It's life, all right? It's no biggie.
HARRY: No biggie? Guy grabs your tit, ""That's life, no biggie""? I mean, what kind of talk is that?  No, you tell me. What kind of talk is that? I can't believe you. I can't believe that that's the reaction that-
HARMONY: See there?
HARRY:Yeah.
HARMONY: I trust you.
HARRY: Right.
HARMONY: What is your problem? I'm letting you off the hook. You didn't do anything.
HARRY: No, but you thought I did. Do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook is my home. Do you understand?  Listen to me. I grab your tit, it's a fucking biggie! That came out wrong. But what I'm saying is you act like, ""Oops, it's an okay lapse. You know, everybody does it. "" What the fuck kind of guys you hang out with here? I mean, are you the kind of girl who like, you know...?
HARMONY: Who what, Harry? Who what?
HARRY: Forget it. I'm sorry, just relax.
Harry heads to the loo. The bathroom is long and deep with the toilet on the far end, a bathtub to the left of the toilet and a towel closet to the right of the toilet.
HARRY: Just get some rest, okay? Okay, we'll start on your case tomorrow. All right? Afternoon good?
HARMONY:  Whatever, Harry. I'm going.
HARRY: Okay.
HARMONY: I'm taking some sweats, all right?
HARRY: Yeah, anything you want to borrow.
HARMONY:  I'll give them back.
HARRY: Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer. If it's in the drawer, it's clean.
Harry is relieving himself standing up when something on the left catches his eye. He turns to look without interrupting the stream. It’s the corpse from the car trunk,  someone's stashed it in his bathroom. He winds up covering the with pee.]
HARMONY: Night, Harry. Harry? This is....This is really great.
HARRY: Isn't it?
HARMONY:  I'm leaving.
HARRY: Yeah, some nice rest.
HARMONY: Bye.
HARRY:  Fuck off-!
PERRY: Say again? They gave her back?
HARRY: Yes. She's in my shower. I'm looking at her, for chrissake.
PERRY: That's impossible. They don't even know you.
HARRY: You're right. The body can't be here. This is all a dream. There's Elmo the elf. Good morning, Elmo! What’s new?
PERRY: Shut up. How did they get in?
HARRY: I don't know.  How am I supposed to know? The goddamn fire escape, maybe.
PERRY:Okay, first things first. We gotta move her somewhere. You got gloves?
HARRY: Excuse me?
PERRY: Gloves. Do you have gloves? You have to move her. If it's a frame-up, some asshole's calling the cops on you right now. Do this: Wrap up the body in a blanket, a sheet, anything.
HARRY: Okay, any particular kind of gloves?
PERRY: Yes, fawn. Will you fucking hurry?
HARRY: Perry?
PERRY: Yeah?
HARRY: I peed on it.
PERRY: What? You peed on what?
HARRY: I peed on the corpse. Can they do, like, an ID from that?
PERRY: I'm sorry, you peed on-?
HARRY: On the corpse. My question is-
PERRY: No, my question. I get to go first. Why in poo-perfect hell would you pee on a corpse?
HARRY: It's not like I did it for kicks. God, you said this doesn't happen. This is your fault!
PERRY:  Shut up and listen. First, we have to wrap the body. Second, you've got to find the gun. Say this with me, ""Find the gun. ""
HARRY: Find the gun, find the gun. Damn it, I threw it in the lake.
PERRY:Not my gun, idiot. They dropped the body on you, it's a frame-up. Then they also have planted a gun, trust me. Move it. I'll be there in four minutes.

COP: Caller specified room 714, some sort of brawl or something. Violent.
CLERK: Yeah, 714. Lockhart. Let me get you the key.
HARMONY:  Actually, it's not 714, it's 514. I was just up there, and it's really noisy.
COP: Let's get the key.
HARMONY:  Yep, pretty awful.
PERRY:  Don't answer that.
HARRY:  Yeah, duh.
PERRY:  That it?
HARRY: No, that's the corpse from the last guy who stayed here.
PERRY: Fuck off. Was there a gun?
HARRY:Yeah, it's right here. Perry, sons of bitches made us, made me. I'm in town for two days, they know who I am and where to find me. Come on!
PERRY: That's impossible.
HARRY: Yeah, it's totally nuts.
PERRY: Back stairway.
HARRY:I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive. She thinks her sister was murdered.
PERRY: Come again?
HARRY:Never mind.
Cut to: OUTSIDE

HARRY: See, these dudes tonight, they see two assholes out of nowhere. What do they think?
PERRY:   They think we know something. They panic. They got a body, they've gotta dispose of the evidence.
HARRY:In my shower? Come on, you said real life.
PERRY:  They were setting you up, dummy. It happens in real life.
HARRY: They're not setting me up. Shut up. You change your tune every five minutes.
PERRY:Kiss me.
HARRY:What? No, no, no.
COP: Check out Doris and Lucinda over here.
HARRY:These lessons suck.  I quit. This is not being a detective. Corpses floating in lakes, people kissing people. This is wrong. This is every shade of wrong.
HARMONY (OS): Somebody wanna fill me in?
HARRY: She thinks I'm a detective, so go along with it.
PERRY: What?
HARRY:Don't fuck me up.
HARRY:Hey.
HARMONY: Do you know the cops are looking for you, Harry?
HARRY:They are?
HARMONY: Yeah. I sent them to the wrong room. I didn't know what else to do.
HARRY:You did fine. Perry and I, we're just-
HARMONY: Hiya, Perry.
HARRY:We're just running, you know, a game.Perry, what do you call it?
HARMONY: What are you talking about, Harry?
HARRY:The old Bring Them In and Push Them Out. That's what we're doing.
HARMONY: What's going on? Why are you and Perry nacking on each other?
HARRY (V.O.): I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet tomorrow to go over her case, and, B, I wasn't actually gay. Do not ask me how I did B.
HARRY:Why didn't we just leave it there?
PERRY: Think, dummy. A 911 call from your hotel room, all of a sudden, there's a corpse outside? Bad idea. Speaking of bad ideas, what's this about you taking on your own case? Of all the dipshit things to do.Killed herself, by the way.
HARRY:Huh?
PERRY:Killed herself. I solved your case for you.
HARRY: No, no, no. Harmony's convinced-
PERRY: I don't care about- Listen to me. Little sis punched her own ticket.
HARRY: Okay. Gotcha.
PERRY: All right, this looks good up ahead. Time to lose the luggage.
HARRY: Sorry, sweetheart. You deserved better.
Day Three: The Little SisterHARMONY (V.O.): Before I left, I got her into foster care.   I've never told you just how awful he treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.
Harry and Harmony are in the restaurant of his hotel.
HARRY:I'll tell you what, I take notes, in general, so if you're just real specific, thorough and precise, that'll help.
HARMONY: I remember only lying to her one time. I said to her:  ""Maybe the man who is living here is not your father.""
HARRY:You told your sister she was adopted, yeah?
HARMONY:  No, I did one better. I told her her real father was an actor who was in the movie that came through town.
HARRY: Jonny Gossamer-
HARMONY:  Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right. I told Jenna one day she'd go to Hollywood and she'd meet her famous, real father.
HARMONY: She believed me, Harry, and she came out here looking for him.
HARRY:Okay, this is a bunch. I can start my process, I guess.
HARMONY: Thank you.
HARRY:I'm on the case.  Here is my card.  It's a magic card, so...
HARMONY:  Wow, ""the Amazing Harold. ""
HARRY: Just say ""abracadabra. ""
HARMONY: What happened, somebody sue you? It used to be ""alakazam"" when you cut me in half. And, not to be picky, but it was ""Harold the Great. ""
HARRY:No, I used to be great, now I'm amazing. Get with it.
PERRY:Hi, it's me. You hear anything?
HARRY:No, there's nothing in the papers, so.... I'm busy working on Harmony's case.
PERRY:What case? Leave her alone. News on Channel 5, just starting. Call me after.
REPORTER: -a kidnapping gone wrong. It is unclear why his daughter was subsequently murdered or where for she was almost certainly killed and then moved, police sources say.  Veronica Dexter was reported missing yesterday afternoon when she failed to greet her boyfriend at the airport. Miss Dexter recently made headlines when she returned from Paris and withdrew her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against her father actor-turned-entrepreneur Harlan Dexter. Mr. Dexter owns the prestigious Dexter Clinic. His wife died last spring, prompting Veronica's return to the U.S. and a father-daughter reconciliation following years of estrangement. Veronica Dexter, 25 years old yesterday. Paul.
Cut to: BUILDING BALCONY
Harry and Perry are talking.
HARRY:We were just at that party. Are you telling me...that the girl in the lake, that was Veronica Dexter?
PERRY: Positive ID, scars, dental records.
HARRY: You talked to your police guy?
PERRY: Yeah, not much there. The lab report came back, no sign of rape. Boils down to this: Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon about 4:30, left her home.Went off to the airport, pick up some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.
HARRY: That was the last anybody saw of her?
PERRY: With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.
HARRY:Police ever find the car?
PERRY: No, genius, that was us. Remember?
HARRY:Oh, yeah, right.
PERRY: The killers were at the party, Harry.
HARRY: They were? The killers were at Dexter's?
PERRY: That's how they recognized you. It's getting too scary. You gotta bail. Get a flight out, today.
HARRY:But I got my screen test Tuesday. I'll go Wednesday.
PERRY: You're not getting the part.
HARRY: Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.
PERRY: You're not gonna get the part
HARRY: I know it's a long shot. I know I’m no Brando…
PERRY: It's not a long shot. Harry! You're not listening to me. You won't get the- Harry! HARRY! You're not gonna get the part, okay?  Colin Farrell wants too much money. Do you get me now? Dabney, he unearths a discovery. New kid, works for cheap. Flies him out here, high profile, parties, screen tests, detective lessons, all of it. You were just being used. Shave a couple million off of Colin Farrell's price tag. Sorry, chief. There it is. I'm not gonna lie to you anymore. I understand if you wanna take a swing at me.
PERRY: You fuck!
HARRY: You sissy bitch!
PERRY: Stop.  Don't bother asking Harmony out on your date. She wasn't very happy to find out that you're not a detective, that you lied.
HARRY: You told her?
PERRY: Pick those up.Pick them up.
HARRY:Why did you tell her? You didn't have to tell her. I am an idiot. I thought we were friends.
PERRY: We're not friends.
HARRY:I was in trouble, you were there for me.
PERRY:No, I was- Stop speaking. I was there protecting my employer, Dabney. Hello. He pays me to insulate him from corpses. I'm not a nice man, Harry.  Go home before something bad happens to you.
HARRY:What, are you threatening me?
PERRY: No, moron.Go home before the bad guys do something bad to you.
HARRY:Right, I get it. Fine.
PERRY:Merry Christmas. Sorry I fucked you over.
HARRY:No problem. Don't quit your gay job.
Cut to AIRPORT, night
Harry snoozing, then we hear a PA announcing of a flight to Denver that just arrived. While he's waiting for his flight he sees Flicka and tries to chat her up.
HARRY:Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry. Remember me? What's up, honey? How are you?
FLICKA:  She doesn't want to talk to you.
HARRY: Oh, no, no. I know.Did you ever think maybe I don't want to talk to her? I just saw your really distinctive ears.You look different,but it's obviously Flicka. Maybe it's you I'm interested in.
FLICKA: Is that true?
HARRY:Not really. Look, she must have a cell phone, right? She must.
FLICKA: Forget it. This is between you two.
HARRY:Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving. I'm going back to the East Coast, and that's- No? Come on, I just want to say something to her. Just anything before I split. I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.
FLICKA: I'm gonna regret this.
HARRY: No, you're not and that is a very smart suit, by the way.
FLICKA: It's not here, that's funny.
HARRY:What's funny?
FLICKA: Nothing. It's just under her stage name.
HARRY:Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name. What's her stage name?
FLICKA: Ames. Allison Ames.
HARRY: Okay, well, I'll just write it down and then- Hey! Say that name again.
FLICKA: Allison Ames.
HARRY: Allison Ames. A-M-E-S. That's Harmony’s stage name.
FLICKA: I just said that.
HARRY:That's the name on her credit cards.
FLICKA:How am I supposed to know?
HARRY:  Fuck!  Thanks, honey. Gotta roll. Later.
Harry in a cab, talking on the cellphone. We hear Perry’s voice in an answering machine
PERRY (O.S.): You have reached the offices of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.
HARRY: Newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames, it was the little sister. Repeat, the little sister. That's where Harmony's 2 grand went. It's in your bank, you overpriced bastard. Her kid sister hired you. Do you get this? Your case and my case are the same fucking case.
Harmony’s door again. A distressed Harry pounds the door
HARRY: Come on!
HARMONY: Get out of my life!
HARRY:I'm at the airport, right, and I run into Flicka, and she says-
She slams the door on him… and opens it again shortly afterwards
HARMONY: Did I just cut off your finger?
HARRY:Yeah. It's on the floor, to my periph- I don't wanna see it. Pick it up, put it on ice.  Thanks.
He walks into the house, Harmony still angry.
Cut to HOSPITAL
The finger is precariously sewn back on and lightly bandaged up as Harmony’s voice is heard.
HARMONY (VO): You're a genius, Harry. You're a genius. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail on you, but I had to go to work. I am going nuts here. I can't stop thinking about this.
Now he’s in the back of a cab, in a phone call with Harmony.
HARMONY (OS): What's my sister's connection to Veronica Dexter? She predicted that murder, Harry. She sent you and Perry to that exact spot.
HARRY:Yeah, that whole thing is wild. You know what else is nuts? You cut off my finger!
HARMONY: Oh, God, Harry, I am so sorry about that. How is it?
HARRY:It's fine. It's all shut up. They gave me painkillers. I can’t feel a thing. Where's Perry? We gotta find him.
HARMONY:  Perry's coming by here. I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza. Listen. Remember you said the killer may have been at Dexter's party? Well, that whole bunch is here tonight.
HARRY: Honey, put me on the list, I'm gonna drop by. I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.
HARMONY: Maybe you could put the hat in the kettle and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet. Harry, you sound trashed.
HARRY:  Give me the address. I'm coming.
Harry heads over (High as a kite) to the party.
HARRY (V.O.): I showed up mildly whacked on Demerol thinking Harmony's theory wasn't so crazy.
HARRY (V.O.): What if little sis had been murdered by the same assholes who offed Veronica Dexter? Remember? With the ski masks, those dudes. Then and there, I made a decision. If it fucking killed me, I would not stop until I got, like, two more Demerol. No, seriously, I was on the case. Harry Lockhart, L.A.P.I.
HARMONY: Harry, I got it.
HARRY:What do you got?
HARMONY: Just now. My friend Tiff does the video dubbing at Fox.
HARRY:""Lord of the Cock Rings. ""
HARMONY:  No, Harry, it's a fake label. Copyright infringement, she'd get fired. It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.If Jenna was hunting her mystery dad, this is where she would start, right?  Jesus, don't patronize me!
HARRY: I'm not.
HARMONY:  You're patronizing me.
HARRY: No, I'm not. It's just a funny little buzz.
BLONDE: I don't know if this guy's your boyfriend or not but when you were in the bathroom, he was checking me out.
HARRY:What?
HARMONY: Harry!
HARRY:What is it out here with these women?
HARMONY: Please, they're no diferente from anywhere else.
HARRY:They are. These are damaged goods, every one of them, from way back. Take a guy who sleeps with 100 women a year, go into his childhood, dollars to doughnuts, it's relatively unspectacular.  Now, you take one of these gals who sleeps with 100 guys a year and I bet you if you look in their childhood there's something rotten in Denver.
HARMONY: Denmark.
HARRY:   That too. But it's abandonment, it's abuse. It's, ""My uncle put his ping-ping in my papa."" Then they all come out here. It's like someone took America by the East Coast and shook it and all the normal girls managed to hang on.
HARMONY: Okay, everybody who hates Harry here raise their hand.
PERRY: See that? Obedient little bitches too.
GIRL (O.S.): Fuck you!
HARRY: Hey.
PERRY: Okay, you've got 30 of my fucking seconds, thrill me.
Cut to KITCHEN
Harry is putting the “Lord of the Cock Rings” tape on a TV, Harmony gives him a paper
HARMONY: All right, guys, cast list. Perry, catch. That's the credit card my sister used to hire you.
Close on the “Allison Ames” credit card
PERRY:So who's in this cinematic milestone, anyway?
HARRY:  We got a Michael Beck,  whoever that is.
PERRY: He's the star of Xanadu, with Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly.
HARRY:  Gay. 
PERRY: What?
HARRY: Nothing.
HARMONY: Perry, listen up. I know this is a long shot, but indulge me, please.
HARRY:We gotta lose the hat. I'm sorry, honey, I can't-
HARMONY: God, Harry, I'm working!
HARRY: I know, but just forget it.
HARMONY: Seriously, don't jump all over me. Just pay attention. Watch it, please.
PERRY: That's Harlan Dexter.
HARMONY:  What?
HARRY: Who's Har-? What?
PERRY: Look, that's- He's 20 years younger, but that's Harlan Dexter.
Harlan Dexter is indeed the Johnny Gossamer of the movie
GOSSAMER: Always sees the inside of a police van.
Harmony is shocked, puts her hand on her forehead
HARMONY: No way.
HARRY: Wow. This kind of makes sense. He had the Gossamer books at his house.
PERRY:  Used to be an actor.
HARMONY:   Jesus, Harry. I remember him now. 1980. Oh, my God, I saw him like this. Young.
PERRY:   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where?
HARMONY: In Indiana. He was there with the movie crew. Remember, I told you he looked familiar. Oh, God, this can't be true.
HARRY: And your sister has to have seen this, so you know what it comes down to. You tell your sister a fairy tale about her real father-
PERRY: And 20 years later, she comes out to L.A. hunting Harlan Dexter.
Back to the PARTY
PERRY: I've got a surveillance in MacArthur Park. I gotta follow some chick around till midnight. Do not play detective. This is not a book. This is not a movie.
HARRY:We got it. Do you think I'm stupid?
PERRY: You wouldn't know where to feed yourself if you didn't flap your mouth so much. Yes, I think you're stupid.
HARMONY: Harry, don't listen to a word he says, all right? We're getting somewhere.   I'll call you tomorrow. I'm going back to work.
HARRY:Good.
HARRY: Excuse me.
THUG 1: What's up, baby? How you feeling?
HARRY:I'm just gonna-
THUG 2: Come and take a walk. Walk with me.
HARRY: Great, this is fucking rich.
Cut to ROOM
Harry is forced by the duo to sit on a fancy chair in an empty room filled with stuff
THUG 2: Well, now, here we all are: Ike, Mike and Mustard.
HARRY:What the hell does that mean?
THUG 1: I'm with him on this one. That's pretty fucking obscure.
THUG 2: Horseshit. I hear that all the time.
THUG 1: You do?
THUG 2: Yeah, sure.
THUG 1: Where? At the 1942 Club?
THUG 2: Just because you didn't get in…
THUG 1: Motherfucker, I could’ve gotten in…
THUG 1: Hey-ey-EY! Slow your roll, man!
HARRY:This is bullshit. What will you do, take me out here? There's sec-
The short goon punches the bandaged hand, Harry groans
THUG 1:Keep talking. Keep talking.
THUG 2: You wanna know who we are? I'm the frying pan, see? And my boy over here- He's…
THUG 1: Mustard. I'm Mustard, baby.
HARRY:Sure.
MR. FRYING PAN: He's the fire. Fuck you, Mr. Mustard.
MR. FIRE: Here we go.
MR. FRYING PAN: Now, me and my man, we're puzzled lately by your behavior, such as-
MR. FIRE: Such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat like yourself consorting with gay men? Frolicking in the lake and shit together. What is that?
HARRY:You're the guys who were wearing the masks.
MR. FIRE: You don't ask the questions.
MR. FRYING PAN:  Don't ask questions.
Harry’s hand is released, the bandage is all bloodied
HARRY:God, you just tore up my fucking finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!
MR. FRYING PAN:  I bet there's a doctor in New York, clear that shit right up.
MR. FIRE:  Clear it right up.
”Fire\Mustard” punches him in the face
MR. FIRE:  L.A. don't want you no more, tough guy.
MR. FRYING PAN:  All right? 
Cut to STREET
Harmony’s car driving away
HARRY (O.S.): How much further to the hospital?
Harry is in the backseat while Harmony tries taking him to the hospital.
HARMONY: Five minutes away. Talk to me. Our mascot, back in high school, who was it? Come on, Harry, stay with me.
HARRY: Whitey, the white knight. Whitey. I guess it's better than calling him ""Knighty."" Then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.  It's very emasculating.
HARMONY:  Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.
HARMONY: You said it's a black guy and a white guy?
HARRY: Oh yeah, yeah. You're right. Get the plate, call the cops.
HARMONY:  Let me find a pen.
HARRY:  No. Whatever. Watch the road. Are we slowing down?
HARMONY:  No, I'm getting a pen.
HARRY: Are you following them? Better not be.
HARRY:Tell me you're not following them.
HARMONY: I’m not! I'm taking you to the hospital.
HARMONY: Oh, shit. They're turning.
HARRY:What?
HARMONY: Holy shit.
HARMONY: Perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're going to MacArthur Park after Perry!
HARRY: Wait a second! My finger's hanging off. We gotta move on this.
HARMONY: We're gonna go save Perry, really quickly. Then we'll go fix your finger. It'll be like, ""Hey, Perry, look out. "" Boom, back in the car. All right? Cool?
HARRY:  Yeah. This is exhausting.
Harmony parks by the sidewalk. “Mr. Fire” is standing near the parked car.
HARMONY: Bingo. All right. All right, Harry. Twelve o'clock, that's them. One of them is on foot.
The car moves, “Mustard” walks too. Harmony opens the door
HARMONY: God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys, can you take yourself to the hospital?
HARRY: Oh, yeah, sure.
HARMONY: All right, good.I got the gun you gave me.
HARRY:You what?
Cut to PARK
Harmony is entering the park.  A girl with pink hair (Shannyn Sossomon) shows up and Perry starts following her. She purposefully leads him under a bridge where the black thug is, gesturing to him. Harmony sees the white thug is driving up behind Perry - starting to line up in order to run Perry over.
HARMONY: Perry!
She's jumped by the black thug
MR. FIRE: Now, where you going?
He throws her on the ground, starts strangling Harmony.
MR. FIRE: No, no, no. Don't fight it. Let it happen, baby.
Harmony kicks him in the balls, he releases her. She manages to get atop him better of him and knock him out with a headbutt. She gets “Mustard’s” gun and points it at him, but decides to just run for Perry.
HARMONY: Perry!
After getting nearly ran over by the bridge’s traffic, Harmony finally gets to the other side.
HARMONY: Perry, watch out! Goddamn it, turn around!
While jumping off the bridge, Harmony falls and drops the gun. It accidentally fires, hitting a parked car and catching Perry's attention - he spots the approaching car and leaps out of the way. The driver careers toward a hot dog stand destroying tables
HOT DOG VENDOR: Son of a bitch!
Mr. Frying Pan leaves the car, gun in hand, approaches Perry who’s also pointing his pistol at him… and then the hot dog vendor takes out a gun of his own and shoots the thug dead.
HOT DOG VENDOR:  How about that, you fucking animals! Goddamn cocksuckers.
In the chaos, the girl with pink hair runs around looking for an escape. She finds a car with the door open and the keys still in it. Of course, it's Harmony's car with Harry passed out in the back seat. The car leaves.
Back in the car, Harmony runs towards Perry, having just returned from where she left the other thug
HARMONY: Perry.
PERRY:  Where the hell did you come from?
HARMONY: He got away.
PERRY: It's okay. You did good.
HARMONY: I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God.
PERRY:  You did fine. You did fine.
PERRY: We gotta go now.
Cut to: GARAGE
Harry wakes up some hours later in the back seat of the car in a strange garage in a strange house totally confused (which must mean he got there the entire way without the pink-haired girl seeing him lying asleep in the backseat...) He walks around inside calling out for help.
HARRY:Hello?Anyone home?Hello?Anyone home? I got an injury problem. Hello.
MR. FIRE: All right, first things first. You've gotta ditch that car.
PINK WIG: I know, I know. I've- I know you said that there was gonna be consequences, but fuck. I saw him shot to death. I was scared.
MR. FIRE:  Look, it's okay, yeah. We can absolutely talk about it, all right?
PINK WIG: Thank you. Thank you so much.It's nothing against your boss. I'm grateful. I just-
MR. FIRE: I spoke to him. You'll never have to go through anything like that again. I swear.
PINK WIG: Promise?
MR. FIRE:  Yep.
PINK WIG: Who are you? Who are you? Who-?
MR. FIRE: Well, hey. So you still here, huh, tough guy?
MR. FIRE: Oh, you got a gun, I see. Well, damn, you are tough.

HARRY: Sorry.
Harry goes to the kitchen, puts the severed finger in a bowl with ice. He turns to  get some water.
HARRY: Fuck.
A dog comes up and grabs the finger. Harry turns around, sees the bowl was a dog one, and then notices his limb on the dog’s mouth.
HARRY: Hey. Hey! Sit. 
HARRY:  Yeah? What?
PERRY:  Where the hell are you?
HARRY:I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead. Come here, you fuck.
PERRY: Jesus, Harry. Wipe the place clean and get out of there.
HARRY:I want to, but I can't.
PERRY: So do it.
HARRY:My fingerprint's here. The fucking dog's got it.
PERRY:  No one's gonna dust the fucking dog.
HARRY:He's got the finger, asshole with the print part.
PERRY:  Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.
HARRY:Hang on.  Shit. Well, I think.... I think we're safe.
PERRY:Harry? Harry?
HARRY:Hey, Perry, I shot a guy. I never did that before.
PERRY: Harry, listen…
Just as he’s about to break in tears, he turns off the call and the dog approaches. He embraces the puppy.
Aerial shot of dawn arriving in Los Angeles, as a reporter is heard.
REPORTER (V.O.): link to the items found in the Silver Lake home to the kidnap-murder of socialite Veronica Dexter.
Cut to LOBBY
The lobby of Harry’s hotel is playing the news, while Harry, Harmony and Perry are seated in the couches.
REPORTER:Police theorize a falling out between the kidnappers, resulting in at least two deaths, and possibly a third tonight.
PERRY:  So this evening, was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?
HARRY:To tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer always has a way bigger ending.There's always the part where the guy gets tortured.
HARMONY:Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.
HARRY:Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16. That's funny. So this thing, it's over, right? They say the kidnappers are all dead, so....
PERRY:Well, Harry, I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that I still didn't have a few questions.
HARRY: What do you mean?
PERRY:Harmony's sister. If she stumbles on a murder plot, why hire me to film it? Why not simply go to the police?
HARMONY:  Right. And I still think this Veronica Dexter father-daughter business is wanky.
HARRY: So the whole reconcilement thing?
PERRY: ""Reconciliation,"" idiot. Yep. She comes back to the States, drops the lawsuit, moves in with her father.Suddenly they're inseparable?
HARRY:  So, what are you saying? We're gonna, like, probe deeper?
PERRY: Absolutely not.
HARMONY:  What? Perry, what are you talking about? My sister paid you. What, you're gonna bail?
PERRY: Harmony do you want your sister's money back? Done. In the meantime, back off. Before you get me and Harry killed.
He walks away.
Cut to HOTEL FRONT
Harmony waits for a cab, Harry runs to her.
HARRY: Pardon me.Hey, I lucked out. They gave me the same room.
HARMONY: Lucky you.
HARRY: It's pretty good. You wanna come up?
HARMONY: No, I don't wanna come up. Why would I go up there?
HARRY: You got time? They cleaned it.
HARMONY: The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.
HARMONY:You know what, Harry? Stop. Why'd you lie to me?
HARRY:It was an excuse to stay around you. So I think, in the realm of lies-
HARMONY: You are such a dumb-ass. I am so not who you think I am, Harry.
HARRY:And who would that be?
HARMONY:You think I'm- You think I'm amazing. You do. You think I'm so amazing because that's who I told you I'd be. Yeah, that was the game plan.
HARRY:You know what? It worked.
HARMONY: No one else thinks so.
HARRY:My opinion doesn't count?
HARMONY: No, it doesn't. Because you're new here. Look around, there's younger and better.
HARRY:I don't want younger and better, I want you. I'm such a moron. I'm sorry. You know what-
HARMONY: It doesn't matter, I'm going. Look, just- 
HARRY: I'm such an idiot. I steal shit.
HARMONY: Come again?
HARRY: That's what I do for a living. I steal audio-visual components.  I steal. I robbed a house.  I stole this watch. It's a cool watch. It's got this little light thing. I stole this gum from the lobby, because it was kind of a rush. I've never finished anything that I've started my entire life. Not school, not marriage, nothing. And I have this thing where, like halfway in the middle, I just and I cut and run.
HARMONY: Like the other night when you were all over me and you gave up and just went for it with-
HARRY:Prime example. I switched to the ugly friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.She's homely. Don't go. Please.Not yet. This isn't finished.
Harmony stares at him.
HARMONY:  Turn around.
HARRY: Why?
HARMONY: Just turn around.
HARRY: What, my tag's out?
she tugs his tag back into the shirt
HARMONY: This dump have a bar?
HARRY:Yeah.
Cut to: HARRY’S ROOM
Packets of gum hit the sofa as we hear Harry and Harmony, sounding wasted after spending the morning at the hotel bar
HARMONY: Call me ""Slick"" from here on out.
HARRY:That was such a good job.You snagged a ton of gum. I mean, petty theft-
HARMONY: Oh, Harry. I really didn't need that last shot of tequila.
Harmony is stripping in the bedroom to go to sleep, while Harry suddenly thinks of the body in the lake – specifically, the part where he pulled her skirt down.
HARRY: Oh, God.I just had a weird thought. Veronica Dexter. I saw the body up close. Hell, I carried the damn thing. Both times, the dress was soaked through, so it was transparent. So-
HARMONY: God, Harry, where are you going with this?
HARRY: No, no, no. It's just-Perry said this chick was deep into the born-again bit, so it's probably nothing, but just if she had on underwear I didn't see any.
Harmony tugs herself under the blankets
HARRY:  I guess I'm taking the couch.
HARMONY: Yeah. Thanks. Or you can sleep here. But it would only be sleeping, Harry. If that's gonna frustrate you.
HARRY: Let's see.
HARMONY: Oh, Harry. So long ago. Didn't really turn out the way we hoped, did it?
HARRY:  I guess if I racked my brain, I could think of worse places to be.
HARMONY:  Is that so, Whitey?
HARRY:  Whitey? Calling me a knight?
HARMONY:  Maybe, yeah. Except for the boner. That's not too knightly.
HARRY:  The hell it isn't. Actually, it's nightly and most mornings.
She laughs and continues sleeping. A short moment passes, and then Harry puts his arms up, and sits down.
HARRY:  Fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry. I'm thinking- I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...the couch is good.
HARMONY:  What? Stop. Harry.
HARRY:  Or I can keep drinking until it goes away.
HARMONY: Harry, seriously, if you're at all uncomfortable... I am more than happy to do something.
HARRY:  For chrissake, no.
HARMONY: Why not?
HARRY:I don't want you to offer it as- Not, ""It's a courtesy freebie.""
HARMONY: You're so anal.
HARRY:  I don't want the backup: ""Let me just give you a hand here""... as a kind of, like, default backup thing.
She passionately kisses him
HARMONY: You're gonna stop calling me.
HARRY: No. You know, that's crazy. I swear to God, this is it.  You are the dream girl. You always have been. This is destiny.
She kisses him once more
HARMONY: Okay. Before we do this...I have a little confession to make.
An angry Harry is seen tossing stuff at a now-dressed Harmony on his doorstep.
HARRY:  My best friend! You said you were going to drop by his house, wave goodbye.
HARMONY: I was leaving for L.A. I was never gonna see him- He looked sad.
HARRY:  He looked sad?
HARMONY:  Yes, he did.
HARRY:  You slept with Chook Chutney.
HARMONY: Fuck. For chrissake, Harry, it was forever ago. Come on, I was a different person back then.
HARRY:  You slept with Chook. Excuse me.
HARMONY: Come on.
HARRY:  Watch your hand.
HARMONY: Harry!
He slams the door in Harmony’s face. Harmony wanders off,  pays the valet, and is crying when something occurs to her. She calls Harry up.
HARRY:  Yeah.
HARMONY:  Harry, was she raped?
HARRY:  Huh?
HARMONY:  The Dexter girl, was she raped?
HARRY: No, the ME's report showed no indication of rape stuff. You slept with Chook Chutney.
Harry turns off the phone, sees the Johnny Gossamer book in his hand – “You Wouldn’t Want To Live There – and lies down as the screen cuts to black.
Day Four: The Simple Art of MurderPERRY (V.O.):  Wake up. Harry, wake up.
A sleeping Harry gets a pair of pants thrown on his face.
PERRY (O.S.) Get up.
He sits down, Perry sits next to him
HARRY: What's up?
PERRY:  Harmony's in trouble. Get dressed. Let's go.
Cut to: PERRY'S CAR
Harry in the passenger seat. While Perry is driving, he plays a message on his phone.
HARMONY (V.O.):  Perry, it's me. Listen, this Veronica Dexter business stinks. I'm gonna go check on something Harry said. Call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.
PERRY:  What did you say to her?
HARRY: Nothing.I don't get what's happening.
PERRY:  She solved this thing. That sly little minx of yours has solved this case, and now I can't find her.
HARRY: You're worried.
PERRY: You're not worried?
HARRY: Of course. If you are, I should be. Now, what did you say? Think. You said something about the case.
HARRY:Yeah. Yeah.
PERRY: What?
The car brakes suddenly, screeching its tires, and takes a turn
HARRY (V.O.): I tell him about destiny. He's shaking his head. About dream girls, he doesn't care. I mention the underwear thing, he has a fucking conniption.
Cut to: INSANE ASYLUM
Harry frantically smokes a cigarette outside a building, in which we can see in the parking lot a van with the name “H.R. Dexter Mental Health Institute” – the “Dexter Clinic” a reporter mentioned previously.
HARRY (V.O.): And you? How about it, filmgoer? Have you solved the case of the dead people in L.A.? Times Square audiences, don't shout at the screen. And stop picking at that, it'll just get worse.
Harry then enters as Perry opens the door to him.
PERRY: This won't take a second.
HARRY:Right.
They meet a large woman patient, fiddling with a Santa sculpture.
HARRY: (clears throat) Hi. How are you doing tonight?
PATIENT:  They gave away my crickets.
Harry turns on his phone, shows a picture of Harmony
HARRY: Excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance, happen to have seen this woman?
MENTAL PATIENT: No. I don't like him. Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.
HARRY: Of course. That's sad.
PERRY: Ma'am, I hope you won't be offended when I ask you if you're wearing anything at all underneath your hospital blues.Any undergarments. It's important.
She lowers her dress, giggling. The two men are slightly disgusted as they walk away. In a corridor they resume their conversation.
HARRY: That’s it. That's the clue. Veronica Dexter was a patient here.
PERRY: Private mental clinic, where even nice girls don't wear undies.
HARRY:How could she be here and meanwhile, she's out having parties?
PERRY: Think. First she hates her dad, then loves him. Has a lawsuit, withdraws it. Why? I'll tell you why.
A doctor is approaching, they hide in an open room
HARRY:Oh, my God. Oh, my God. So it's two different girls, right? He stashed his daughter in here, and then he put the ringer on the street.
PERRY: All he needed was someone who looks enough like his daughter to withdraw the complaint. It's been 10 years.
HARRY: This is nuts.
PERRY: It's right out of a Gossamer book.
HARRY: Of course, because the guy who planned the crimes has all the books. He's read them all. They're in his house. Plus, he was in that piece of shit… movie.
Perry puts one pointer finger in his nose, points the other at Harry.
HARRY: You're telling me the girl imposter-
PERRY:  A desperate man needs a replacement daughter. Same time along comes a girl…
HARRY: Harmony's sister. Fresh off the bus, looking for her dad.dy
PERRY: I'd say I found my imposter.
HARRY:Let's get out of here.
Harry and Perry head out from the asylum, and are then seen outside the clinic.
HARRY: So where did she go from here?
PERRY:  Shut up, I'm thinking.
HARRY: By the way, this thing:  Single gayest thing you've ever done.
GUARD: Evening, gentlemen.
PERRY:Hi, we are so incredibly lost.
GUARD: Mr. Van Shrike, hello. You look chilly. Come back inside.
PERRY:Actually, I'm from back East. I'm kind of digging the cold.
HARRY: Agh! Fuck! He's the one who said it.
GUARD:  Or I can kill you here.
PERRY:Harry, I was thinking some more about this reality versus fiction.
HARRY: Oh, is that a fact.
PERRY:Like in the movies, when a guy sticks a gun at some schmuck's back and says: ""Let's take a walk. "" He's got a hostage.
HARRY:I've seen that movie.
PERRY:In reality, the pros like about five feet of separation.
HARRY: Right, huh?
PERRY:That's so the schmuck doesn't take the gun back  and make him eat it.
HARRY:Doesn't that suck? I just hit you for no reason. Watch it.
PERRY: Tell us where Harmony is.
GUARD:   Fuck you, Mary.
PERRY: You don't get it, do you? This isn't ""good cop, bad cop. "" This is fag and New Yorker. You're in a lot of trouble. For chrissake, who are you protecting? It's all over, fini. Dexter is going down.
HARRY:Down.
PERRY:  I know about Veronica's lawsuit. I know Dexter was facing ruin. I even know he switched daughters. Which, for God's sake, actually did work for a while, till last week.
HARRY:What happened that he had to kill her, huh?
PERRY: Harry, put a sock in it.
HARRY:I'm asking a question.
PERRY:  If you ask questions then it seems like we don't know anything, that we’re dishing. Okay? And for the record, it was the boyfriend, the guy from Paris. He would've spotted the fake and said, ""That's not Veronica."" Am I right?
GUARD: Fuck you!
PERRY:  Exactly. So Dexter had Veronica killed, threw a dress on her dumped the body and walked away clean, except for one little thing.
HARRY: Underpants.
PERRY: One tiny little pair of undies.
HARRY: Yeah.
PERRY: You think that's funny, huh? I'm gonna break your nose now.
PERRY: I want you to picture a bullet inside your head. Can you do that for me?
PERRY: Fuck you. Anyway, that's ambiguous.
PERRY: Ambiguous? I don't think so.
HARRY: No, I think it means when you say, ""Picture it inside your head"", is that ""a bullet will be inside your head"" or ""picture it in your head""?
PERRY: Harry, will you shut up.
GUARD: I don't know anything about a girl, seriously. I was bluffing.
HARRY: I think that you are bluffing right now.
PERRY: Harry, what are you doing?
HARRY:What I'm doing for the guy who likes to bluff is I'm playing a little game called ""Am I Bluffing?""   Huh! Where is she?
PERRY: Harry.
HARRY: Where the fuck is Harmony? You want to play hardball?  Where is the girl?
PERRY: What did you just do?
HARRY: I just put in one bullet, didn't I?
PERRY: You put a live round in that gun?
HARRY: Yeah, there was like an 8 percent chance.
PERRY: Eight? Who taught you math?
HARRY: Maybe it was more. I don't know-
PERRY: Shit!  Hello?
HARMONY: Perry, is that you? Hey, it's me.
PERRY: Hi, Harmony.
HARMONY: What's going on?
PERRY: Where are you?
HARMONY: At home.
PERRY: You're at home?
HARMONY:  I just got back. I was in the Hills all day. Shitty reception.
PERRY: You don't sound so good.
HARMONY: Why aren't you following your lead?
PERRY: Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.
HARMONY: No, it's not crazy. Listen- It's right out of a Gossamer book.
PERRY: Don't talk. Listen.
HARRY: Times 12… Eight percent.
PERRY: And you, stop multiplying.
HARMONY:Huh?
PERRY: No, not you. Listen, call downtown, see if Veronica Dexter's body has gone to the mortuary. If it has, see if there's a cremation scheduled.
HARMONY:  Wait, Perry.
PERRY:Call me back right away.
PERRY:Look, he was gonna kill you anyway. He said so. Cover him up. I'll get the car.
HARRY: All right, that's pretty much all done.
PERRY: Harry-
HARRY:I got an idea. I say we take the son of a bitch Dexter down...
HARRY:...to the racetrack and buy the son of a gun a drink. What do you say, Perry? Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.
HARLAN: Aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike a little pat down.
AURELIO: Fucking maricón.
HARLAN: Toss it here. Let's see who it is.
HARRY: We're in trouble. Dexter's got us.
AURELIO: He just asked a carpet-cleaning service to save him.
HARLAN:  Sorry, kid. Good hands, though.
HARRY:Thanks. Used to be a magician.
HARMONY: And for 39.99 we'll carpet up to three rooms in half the time. That's a $40 value. Act today.
HARRY:That chick in the casket, she won't even match up with that ringer you been toting around. You ever think about that?
PERRY:He did, Harry. That's why he's cremating the body.
HARLAN: Yeah, you ready?
HARLAN:Speak of the devil. Gotta go. Perry, nice to have known you.
HARRY: Harry.
Harry. Yes, of course. Harry from New York. I hope you don't judge Los Angeles based solely on your experience tonight.  Ouch.
HARRY:I'm kind of scared here, Perry.
PERRY:Aurelio, why don't you give the kid a break?
PERRY: Do unto others and all that. It's Christmas.
AURELIO: Who else knows? Who did you tell?
HARRY:I don't know anything.I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.

THUG: Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.
HARLAN: Okay, let's burn the bitch.
PERRY:  You could zap his chest. It'd be easier.  But we know why you gotta do it down there. You like looking at his johnson, don't you? Admit it, dude, you got it in you.
AURELIO: Enough!
PERRY: Aurelio, look me in the eyes and tell me you've never been with a man.
AURELIO: Fuck you, maricón! Fuck you!
PERRY: That's what you want, isn't it? You want to fuck me.
HARRY:Stop helping. Stop helping.
PERRY: If you are not gay, just say so.
AURELIO:  Fuck you, maricón!
PERRY: Look at him. He can't even say it.
HARRY:Stop helping!
AURELIO:  Can't wait to have you as a patient.
PERRY: Bet you can't.
PERRY:  This is what you want. Here.
AURELIO:  Shut up!
PERRY:  Take a look. You want some of this right here? Look at this.
AURELIO: Just shut up!
HARRY:Yeah!
PERRY:  Homophobes never check there.
HARRY: Thank God you had a gun in there. I thought it was a gay thing, like somehow you guys could do that. Sorry.
PERRY:   Are you okay?
HARRY: Not really, no.
THUG 1: Gentlemen, let's wrap it up and get out of here.
THUG 2: Who's driving?
THUG 3:I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.
THUG 1: All right.
THUG 1: This way, come on.
THUG 2: Shit!
HARMONY: Yeah.
PERRY: Hey, Harmony, it's me.
HARMONY: Oh, God, how did you get away?
PERRY: I shot him with a small revolver I keep near my balls. I can't get to my car. We're near Olive and the freeway. Can you pick us up?
HARMONY: I'm in a van with Veronica’s body. I'll be there in 30 seconds. All right, be where I can see you. Be ready to move.
HARMONY: Shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.
HARRY: Right there. She's right there!
HARRY:Shit.
HARRY: Harmony!
Harmony crashes the van on an overpass, sending the coffin over the edge. It lands on a sign above the underpass. An arm pops out. Harmony's OK, though, and leaves the cabin. Harry and Perry keep running up.
HARRY: Harmony!
Harmony runs away just as a thug’s car hits the flipped van. He brakes, gets out of the car, and tries to shoot Harmony. She jumps off the road and into a median, slamming her forehead on the grass and drawing blood. Up there, Harry and Perry are approaching.
HARRY:  Harmony!
PERRY: Harry, don't!
HARRY:Come on, we gotta go. They're coming back around. Harmony's down there. Perry, what's wrong? Come on, breathe.

HARMONY: Harry.
HARMONY: Harold.
HARMONY: Harold...  use your awesome might.  Save me from this hopeless plight. Harold...
HARRY:Harmony!
HARLAN:Captain Fucking Magic.
HARRY:Come on!
HARRY:No.
HARRY:There, all done.  Finished.
HARMONY: Harry.
HARRY:Did you call me?
HARMONY: Harry, you're shot.
HARRY:No, no. Look, you want to see something cool?
HARMONY: Cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry.  No, not really.
HARRY: Oh, not really.
HARMONY: Oh, Harry. Oh, God, Harry. Harry.

HARMONY: Hi. Welcome back.
HARRY: Yeah.
HARMONY: How many fingers?
HARRY: Will you put that cat down, because I'm allergic.
HARMONY: You feeling okay? How's your...?
HARRY: My what?
HARMONY:  Well, your....
HARMONY:  Everything down there.
HARRY: I can't believe he told you that.
HARRY: Hey, hey, hey. It's Christmas, where's my present, Slick?
PERRY: Your present is you're not in jail, fag-hag.
HARRY (V.O.): Yeah, boo, hiss, I know. Look, I hate it too. In movies where the studio gets all paranoid about a downer ending, so the guy shows up, he's magically alive on crutches, I hate that.  I mean, shit, why not bring them all back.  But the point is, in this case, this time, it really happened. Perry, like, lived. Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing but what do you want me to do, lie about it?
HARMONY: So you found something out?
PERRY:Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.Dexter didn't murder your sister.
HARMONY: That's crazy. He was using my sister to impersonate his daughter, Perry.
PERRY:Never happened. I talked to my police guy. The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye, 23-year-old from Glendale.When she wasn't impersonating Veronica Dexter... ...she wore a pink wig.
HARMONY: But my sister sent you up to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.
PERRY: Your sister was convinced that Dexter was her natural father, so she started following him, hanging around. Do you see where I'm going with this? One day your sister came calling, and she saw Dexter...
PERRY (V.O.):...in bed with the pink-haired girl.What she thought was father and daughter. Remember, that's how it would appear.
PERRY: It was too much for her. First the old father, now the shiny new one.She couldn't handle it, and she took her own life. What she hired me to film wasn't murder, but incest. I'm sorry.
HARRY (V.O.):So much for unreality. I said goodbye, watched Jonny's world go back on the fiction shelf. But while it lasted, brother...  it was one for the books.
Harry helping Perry, who’s walking with a cane, down the hospital corridor.
PERRY:You should've told me you were arrested five times. I should be pissed.
HARRY:You should have told me that when you go home, you put on lady's underpants.
PERRY:That's cross-dressing, imbecile.
HARRY:Whatever.
PERRY:Half those guys are straight. Perfect fathers, love their kids. How about you? Did your father love you?
HARRY:Sometimes. You know, when I dressed up like a bottle. How about yours?
PERRY: Well, he used to beat me in Morse code, so it's possible... but he never actually said the words.Harry.
HARRY:What?
PERRY:Don't steal any more shit. You're not a punk.
A male nurse passes by them, Perry turns back.
PERRY:You bet I'll turn around.
HARRY:You like that, huh?
PERRY:  I saw him in the commissary twice. What is he, like 6'4""?He doesn't know he's gay. Look how he walks.
Epilogue: Farewell, My LovelyFlyover of an Indiana town
HARRY (V.O.): So that's pretty much that.  We went back to Indiana, the three of us, for Jenna's funeral. Don't worry, I saw the last Lord of the Rings.I won't have the movie end 17 times.  There is, though, one final scene for your viewing pleasure.
Inside a house, Perry confronts Harmony's father, who's on oxygen and bedridden
HARMONY’S DAD: Do I know you?
PERRY:  No. Just in town for the funeral.
HARMONY’S DAD:  What do you want?
PERRY:  The zoo was closed, so I thought I'd come here and look at an animal.
HARMONY’S DAD: Son of a- Who do you think you're talking to?  I buried my daughter today.
PERRY:  No. You buried her 20 years ago. Harmony was right, her sister was murdered. You pulled the trigger. It just took this long for the bullet to hit.
HARMONY’S DAD: Who are you? I loved my girl.
Perry backhands him
HARMONY’S DAD: You fucker! If I could get out of this bed-
PERRY:  Yeah? Well, you can't.
Perry backhands him again
HARMONY’S DAD:You bastard! An old man that can't defend himself. Big tough guy.
PERRY:  Yeah, that's right.  Big tough guy.
Perry leaves. As he passes by the living room, the Genaros commercial is seen on the TV… only instead of Harmony, it’s the blonde girl who Harry met before introducing Harmony.
One year later. Harry, much better dressed, is making a video recording of himself telling the whole story in an office.
HARRY:That's it. That's the true story of what happened last Christmas. That was some pretty harsh shit with the old guy back there, right? But whatever, he's creepy. Fuck him. Don't worry about him. Anyhow, so... Thanks for coming. Thanks for taking the trip to L.A. with me. If I had to sum it up, and I do-Because, you know, it's, like, the end.
HARRY:I would say that this movie is about- It's about friendship. Friendship is sacred.
Perry enters, carrying a folder
PERRY:   What are you doing?
HARRY:I'm trying to wrap up the movie  and leave the people with a message.
PERRY:  I've got a message for you. Get your feet off my fucking desk.
HARRY: Sorry.   I work for Perry now.
PERRY:  And stop narrating.
HARRY: Obviously.
PERRY:   That's it. Please stay for the end credits. If you're wondering who the best boy is, it's someone's nephew.  Don't forget to validate your parking. For all of you good people in the Midwest, sorry we said ""fuck"" so much.  Say good night.
HARRY: Thanks again.
PERRY:  Now, go. Vanish."

Another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head
From what went down last night
I know we both have our own little ways
But somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say
I guess it don't even matter

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?

I've always listened to your point of view, my ways I tried to mend
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better

Is only make-believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire

Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street

Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style

Run Home Girl,sad cafe,1979,1970,"Wilson-Young
Love has a strange way of finding out
Everything in your heart
Strangest of all is you never know
Just what it is that's tearing you apart
Seasons may pass, summers come and go
Dreams flashing through your mind
Love is something that you dream about
Something that you left behind
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Time has a strange way of reaching out
The years turn to yesterday
Reach out a hand, try to grab the past
Stop it all slipping away
Happens to you almost anywhere
A flash before the storm
Just reach out a hand, try to touch her face
Only to find she is gone
Just like I told you again
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Never known love burn so bright
Little girl could have been so right
We could have been so happy
I won't be there
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Love has a strange way of turning round
When happiness turns to pain
Something that you thought you had has gone
And somehow things will never be the same
That hurt gets so bad as the days go by
A hurt that no drug can cure
There's only one thing that can satisfy
There's only one thing I'm longing for
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting

Better run home girl as fast as you can

By The Light Of The Silvery Moon,jimmy bowen ,1958,1950,"I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.
—Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?
—Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?
—Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.
—What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.
—Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.
—Circumcised? says Joe.
—Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.
—That the lay you're on now? says Joe.
—Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?
For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.
—Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.
—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.
—What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.
—Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.
—Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
—Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.
—Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
—Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
—Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
—-What was that, Joe? says I.
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.
So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.
—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.
—Stand and deliver, says he.
—That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
—Pass, friends, says he.
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
—What's your opinion of the times?
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.
—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
—Foreign wars is the cause of it.
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
—It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.
—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.
—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.
—Wine of the country, says he.
—What's yours? says Joe.
—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.
—Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
—And there's more where that came from, says he.
—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.
—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.
—For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.
And he starts reading them out:
—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...
—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.
—I will, says he, honourable person.
—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.
—Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...
And he doubled up.
—Take a what? says I.
—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
—O hell! says I.
The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
—Bi i dho husht, says he.
—Who? says Joe.
—Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
—Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...
And he started laughing.
—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
—What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?
—What's that? says Joe.
—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.
—Are you codding? says I.
—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
So Joe took up the letters.
—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:
—How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?
—I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...
—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
—With Dignam, says Alf.
—Is it Paddy? says Joe.
—Yes, says Alf. Why?
—Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
—Ay, says Joe.
—Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.
—Who's dead? says Bob Doran.
—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?
—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?
—Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.
—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.
—Paddy? says Alf.
—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
—Good Christ! says Alf.
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.
He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
—Who? says I.
—Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
—Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:
—Who said Christ is good?
—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.
—He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.
—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
—The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.
—Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.
So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.
—O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?
And he starts reading out one.
7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.
Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...
—Show us, Joe, says I.
—... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...
—Jesus, says I.
—... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...
The citizen made a grab at the letter.
—Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.
H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.
—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.
—They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
—There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
—What's that? says Joe.
—The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.
—That so? says Joe.
—God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.
—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.
So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!
Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.
—Ay, ay, says Joe.
—You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
—Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
—God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.
—Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.
—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
So he calls the old dog over.
—What's on you, Garry? says he.
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.
The curse of my curses
Seven days every day
And seven dry Thursdays
On you, Barney Kiernan,
Has no sup of water
To cool my courage,
And my guts red roaring
After Lowry's lights.
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.
—I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.
Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:
—Could you make a hole in another pint?
—Could a swim duck? says I.
—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.
—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?
—Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.
—Whose admirers? says Joe.
—The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.
—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.
—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.
And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.
So Terry brought the three pints.
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.
—Slan leat, says he.
—Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.
—Friend of yours, says Alf.
—Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?
—I won't mention any names, says Alf.
—I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.
—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.
Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.
—Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
—That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?
—Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.
Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)
Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.
(Ironical opposition cheers.)
The speaker: Order! Order!
(The house rises. Cheers.)
—There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?
—Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.
—Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.
—Is that really a fact? says Alf.
—Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.
Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.
—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?
—No, says Joe.
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
—Who? Blazes? says Joe.
And says Bloom:
—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.
—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.
—-True for you, says Joe.
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:
—Now, don't you think, Bergan?
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.
—He is, says Joe. Isn't he?
—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.
—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.
—My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.
He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.
Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.
Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.
—Hello, Ned.
—Hello, Alf.
—Hello, Jack.
—Hello, Joe.
—God save you, says the citizen.
—Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?
—Half one, says Ned.
So J. J. ordered the drinks.
—Were you round at the court? says Joe.
—Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.
—Hope so, says Ned.
Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.
—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.
—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.
—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.
—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
—Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.
—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.
—Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.
—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.
—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.
—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...
—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.
—That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.
Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.
—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.
Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
—Good health, Ned, says J. J.
—-There he is again, says Joe.
—Where? says Alf.
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.
—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
—Remanded, says J. J.
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
—Who tried the case? says Joe.
—Recorder, says Ned.
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.
—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?
—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.
—Rely on me, says Joe.
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.
—O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.
—Consider that done, says Joe.
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.
—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.
—Decree nisi, says J. J.
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
—Give us a squint at her, says I.
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
—There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.
—Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?
O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.
—It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.
So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.
—The European family, says J. J....
—They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.
And says John Wyse:
—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
—Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!
He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.
—What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.
—Gold cup, says he.
—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
—Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.
—And Bass's mare? says Terry.
—Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.
So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
—Not there, my child, says he.
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.
And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.
—Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?
—As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...
—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
—And will again, says Joe.
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.
And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?
—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?
—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?
—I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.
And says John Wyse:
—'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.
—That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.
—But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?
Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.
—We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...
—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.
—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?
—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.
—Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.
—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!
—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.
And says J. J.:
—Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.
—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
—Yes, sir, says he. I will.
—You? says Joe.
—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.
—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
—Yes, says Bloom.
—What is it? says John Wyse.
—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:
—Or also living in different places.
—That covers my case, says Joe.
—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.
—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.
—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.
—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.
—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
—That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.
—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
—I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.
—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.
—But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.
—What? says Alf.
—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.
Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
—Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.
—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.
Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.
—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.
—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?
—What's that? says Joe.
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:
—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.
—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.
—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.
—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
—No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.
—That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
—Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?
—Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.
—Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.
—I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
—Who? says I.
—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?
—That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.
—He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
—There you are, says Terry.
Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.
—Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.
—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!
So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.
—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?
Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.
—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
—Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?
—That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
—Who made those allegations? says Alf.
—I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?
—Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.
—Who is Junius? says J. J.
—We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
—He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.
—Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.
—That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!
—Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.
—Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.
—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.
—En ventre sa mère, says J. J.
—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.
—A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.
—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.
—Amen, says the citizen.
—And I'm sure He will, says Joe.
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.

And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.
—Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.
—Qui fecit coelum et terram.
—Dominus vobiscum.
—Et cum spiritu tuo.
And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:
—Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.
—And so say all of us, says Jack.
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...
—No, says Martin, we're ready.
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.
—Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,
—Beg your pardon, says he.
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
—Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.
—Bye bye all, says Martin.
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.
—-Off with you, says
Martin to the jarvey.
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.
—Let me alone, says he.
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:
—Three cheers for Israel!
Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:
—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
And says he:
—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.
—He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.
—Whose God? says the citizen.
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.
—By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.
By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.
A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontlátásra, kedves baráton! Visszontlátásra! Gone but not forgotten.
Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:
—Where is he till I murder him?
And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.
—Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.
—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of débris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.
You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?
And he shouting to the bloody dog:
—After him, Garry! After him, boy!
And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel."

Willow,taylor swift,2020,2020,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"
The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You),nat king cole,2020,2020,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you"""

Laugh Now Cry Later,drake ,2020,2020,"Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?"
I Hope,gabby barrett ,2020,2020,"I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Like you did on me"
Champagne Problems,taylor swift,2020,2020,"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"
