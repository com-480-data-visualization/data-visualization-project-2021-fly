eastside,"benny blanco, halsey ",2019,2010,"Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set"
wait for you,elliott yamin,2007,2000,"I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside
This is not how you want it to be

Baby, I will wait for you
Baby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do

Baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting"
wildflower,skylark,1973,1970,"She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears still rings in midnight silence in her ears
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
And if by chance I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
But if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden to be mine
Be careful how you touch her, for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows that only she can hear
And so she goes
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
Let her cry for she's lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild
She's free"
even though i'm leaving,luke combs,2019,2010,"Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere"

Yeah, if I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed

Of breaking glass on my Range Rover

And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya

Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

you make it easy,jason aldean,2018,2010,"Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face

smack that,akon ,2006,2000,"Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

run this town,"jay-z, rihanna ",2009,2000,"Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything

I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care

This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming

Why torture me?

Darling, if you love me
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
These foolish fears out of my mind
Why can't our romance just
Keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious
'Cause true love is so hard to find

Torments my heart

Where a carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were
No different fellas than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know

Everybody had another
No one was facing this cold alone
This cold alone, cold alone, cold alone
They were gathered between bridges
In the steely sunshine
Bookend by ice on either side
Here comes a pair on final approach
Wings like great white bellows
Gathering inward to land and it looks like grace
Looks like grace, looks like grace

summertime,d.j. jazzy jeff ,1991,1990,"Drums Please!

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind"
come back when you grow up,bobby vee,1967,1960,"Come back when you grow up, girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy, lovin's twice as tough

You look real good like a woman now
Your mind hasn't gotten the message somehow
So if you can't take it 'n' the goin' gets rough
Come back, baby, when you grow up
I want you girl but your wide-eyed innocence
Has really messed up my mind, yeah-eah-eah
I'd rather you get your very first heartbreak
Somewhere else along the line
Come back when you grow up, girl

Some day be a woman ready to love

In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kinda groovy
I call you up and ask you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
At first you say no you've got some plans for tonight
And then you stop and say, ""alright""
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a fellow looks at you
You'd be sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky!

If you decide someday
To stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying
Just like a ghost
You've been a-haunting my dreams
So I propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy
With a spooky little girl like you
Spooky!

Beats bound to get you up, cold flowin' like a faucet
Not mean to make you sit, not mean to make you jump
But yep make the hotties in the party shake your rump

It seems like it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a-flashin'
Taxicabs and buses
Passin' through the night
A distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain
To the night

A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, or think of it
It's life, and you just got to play the game

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take my guitar
To pass some time
Late at night, when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I feel fine (I)

But it's a rainy night in Georgia
Baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia

alone again (naturally),gilbert o'sullivan,1972,1970,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
All about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
crazy,gnarls barkley,2006,2000,"I remember when

There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"

ring my bell,anita ward,1979,1970,"I'm glad you're home

I guess you did by the look in your eyes

Well lay back and relax while I put away the dishes
(put away the dishes)
Then you and me can rock-a-bye

You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell

The night is young, and full of possibilities
Well come on, and let yourself be free
My love for you, so long I've been saving
Tonight was made for me and you

bleeding love,leona lewis,2008,2000,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding (Oohhh)
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding (I keep...)
Keep, keep bleeding love

Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love"

a lover's concerto,the toys,1965,1960,"How gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow?
Birds, high up in the trees
Serenade the clouds with their melodies
Oh, see, there beyond the hill
The bright colors of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us just to fall in love
Now, I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me
Oh, don't ever make me cry
Through long, lonely nights without us
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally
Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful"

My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like a wind-blown sand
And a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you, thank you for the gleam that flows its grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you
Sunny, yesterday, oh, my life was filled with rain

You had teardrops in your eyes

It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)

could've been,tiffany,1988,1980,"The flowers you gave me are just about to die
When I think about
What could've been
Makes me want to cry
The sweet words you whispered didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold
What could've been on a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere
Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all
At all

How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night"

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up

I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""

Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

seasons in the sun,terry jacks,1974,1970,"Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and A-B-Cs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them, I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone

Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

7 years,lukas graham,2016,2010,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old"

clair,gilbert o'sullivan,1972,1970,"Clair, the moment I met you, I swear
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me, which I couldn't see
And then, the moment I met you, again
I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so, it couldn't be, No
But try as hard as I might do, I don't know why
You get to me in a way I can't describe
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
I don't care what people say
To me you're more than a child
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair, if ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you in all that you do
But why in spite of our age difference do I cry
Each time I leave you I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say
""I'm going to marry you
Will you marry me, Uncle Ray""
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair, I've told you before ""Don't you dare""
""Get back into bed""
""Can't you see that it's late""
""No you can't have a drink""
""Oh, alright then, but wait just a minute""
While I, in an effort to babysit, catch up my breath
What there is left of it
You can be murder at this hour of the day
But in the morning this hour will seem a lifetime away
Oh Clair
Clair
Oh Clair"
can't help falling in love ,ub40,1993,1990,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
I can't help
Falling in love with you

As a river flows
Gently to the sea

Some things were meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life, too

take good care of my baby,bobby vee,1961,1960,"My tears are fallin'
'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's somethin' that I've got to say

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinkin' of her
In everything you say and do

Oh, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I'd been true
I know she'd never be with you
So, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Well, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Oh, take good care of my baby
Well, take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby"
strangers in the night,frank sinatra,1966,1960,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

roar,katy perry,2013,2010,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

all that she wants,ace of base,1993,1990,"She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
""Oh, what a morning""
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby, yeah)

disco duck (part i),rick dees ,1976,1970,"Intro
This right here is a vocal exercise
Verses and freestyles, 3 to 1, that's a ratio
Ayo so lemme explain how this is gonna work
When you hear this sound (Gun Cock)
That means I'm about to go in off the top of my head
Everything else is pre written
These verses are all wordplay
The tone and the emotions of the lyrics change
They progress in the same way as the album does
Think of all these verses as the cracks between the songs
It's extra. I want to recap what's been going on and start to hint for what's to come
This is where I, elaborate on what I mean
You know, this’ll, this’ll help explain my ideology
There's knowledge hidden in here that's gonna make the album click together
No Backups, no editing, it’s just gonna be one vocal track ya know?
I’m gonna keep it nice and simple
Simple beat
And I'm a real emcee so I don't need a crazy beat to flex
I just let my lyrics do the talking
So uh, how long did I make this beat?
45 minutes? Yeesh, alright...Let’s go
Verse 1
Ayo, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with N!cky G
I run rap like track like Steve P
Ooh-wee
I got the lyrical heat
The inferno that burns through your journal (Mos Def)
I'm out for blood like a Crip
I'm swashbuckling ships
Put my roots with my loot like a pirate
All my music, Internet pirate-
-ed
I'm violent when my mind is dilate
I spit so much it drips on my own dick
The only thing I'm riding is my own dick
And the only thing I write is my own shit
That's a shot at ghostwriters and my consciousness
So let me tell you what my options is
I can either be pompous or an optimist
And I can even sell celibates if I was a black market auctionist, the new clients monogamous
I got this shit like a gastroenterologist
I like to pop my zits
And be with
A B.I.G. butt Notorious (bitch!)
Shut up and listen I got more christenings to give
I'm a monster like the loch ness
I could ground you up and eat you like sausage
And if you're easily nauseous don't watch this cause
I'll go straight for your esophagus
Just playin, I kill ‘em with kindness
I'm full of life like metropolis
You know I rock this shit
Swing a sword at it like a Boblikin
Leave your one legged friend hobbling
And I got lines like red Robins fries, bottomless
Verse 2
Sometimes I don't believe in myself like I'm heaven sent
Sometimes I don't feel myself, self-celibate
I could save a million lives and find a way to talk myself out of the relishment
Cause nothings ever good enough for a perfectionist
I've been too negligent with my intelligence
I've been a resident inside of being hesitant
Focused on the irrelevant
No longer can that be my precedent
Time to develop my replenishment
And Let my actions become the evidence
I got big shoes to fill now
I grew up and filled out
But a lot of my dreams spilled out
I robbed myself and took the till out
Feeling like I shot myself in the face
With bullet cases
Put holes in a lot of situations
But now I'm trying to raise my innovations
Climb to the top of the Appalachians
Where I can grasp my aspirations
That's why I bleed in every rap that I'm making
Every beat is yeast, I been baking
The lines are the icing to complete the cake
I had patterns of bulimia so I stuff my face
I wilted, but I put new flowers in the vase
Water myself everyday
Sunk in my roots
Opened my eyes, to obtuse
More than right, then left into flight
Got high I'm off my vocal pipe
Then ate the ripe fruit
Happiness is the pursuit
Shoot any dispute
Ain't no problem I can't compute
Ain't no dispute I can't compute
And I'm en route to becoming the progidy
I’m en route to becoming the progidy
I’m en route to becoming the prog…prodigy
I’m en route to becoming to prodigy I was when I was 10
Except now I'm a grown man
I can really do things now I don't have to pretend
Like I used to in my bed-
Room, look at the starts out my window and tell myself ""I'll be there soon""
Verse 3
I started out as whack
I took the time to fine tune my craft
Fast forward my time lapse
Now I rhyme tight with no slack, I'm back, I’m back, I’m back, I’m back
I'm back and you’re addicted to me like smack
So INhale my words like crack
Relax and let your eyes roll back
I'll align your spine with a tap
I can see my abs now I sat up, I got a six-pack now
But that doesn't add up, my hunger should mean I'm Santa Claus fat now
At last I finally found my knack
I took the bite from the apple on your mac
And regurgitated it back into this rap
I got more lines than topography maps
I more obsessed with myself than making sure that you clap
But I know you're sitting there in your chair making your head move forward and back
I molded these rhymes to be harder than a cast
I reed(read) and breathe more jazz than a sax
I stick to my pacts I'm truthful like that
I snack on anything like a pack of rats
I'll give you a smack if you say you hate blacks
But as a matter of fact, I hate black cats
If I see one in my path, fuck that I'll take the long way back
And I'm a scholar in college but don't ever say that I'm frat rap
That's whack crap about smashing fat racks and raping girls with fat asses
IF I EVER SAW THAT HAPPEN I WOULD RIP OFF YOUR NUTSACKS
I kid, but don't give me a reason to create a bloodbath
Chorus
Clips, Clips, Clips, Clips
Reload (Gun Cock)
Reload (Gun Cock)
Reload…Shoot
Freestyle 1
(I see these things, these things that I bring
The metal, wood and clay to which I cling
Which I think
Will be what I die from
So I might as well enjoy it now so why run?
I put the world in my lungs
I think I’ll die young
And spit it to you as the truth from the blunt that I speak
And spit it to you as the truth from the tongue that I speak
Listen to me spit these bars as I’m freestyling)
Verse 4
This is a warpath you can track by the bloodbath
Contractions of a muskrat
Jump the fuck back
I got my palm on my nutsack
My other palm’s in the palms that consist of my dub sac, Ha!
I got a Backwood under my mustache
I hide my eyes with some sunglass-es
I copped for free, fuck your logo fashion
I'm comfortable with who I am, I don't need to be masked in
I'm back and back in as the captain of these captions
An assassin with verb-al actions
You, plus your crew, is still a subtraction
I'm narcissistic I only think about my rations
My mind is the abstract rap contraption so fasten
Your seat belts, this is a wild ride
Resurrection from a mind that died
Guided back into the life of light
Then applied with a wide stride of pride
Never slip or slide
Never tongue-tied
I reside in music to confide
In my thoughts ideas and fears
I'm in gear and I’m not looking at the rear view mirror
I found my career
It appeared at a severe time of fear
I engineered it to be premier
And Now I see with my ears
And I'm in the clear of the frontier
Fight or flight?
Stress me I might take your life
Smite ya with the height of what I cite
Take a bite
I'm a knight of the night
I dwell in the moonlight when the ghouls have goon fights
I'm outright polite face to face
But when I write, I might just put you in your place
I got the sleight of hand, point and case
I work real hard every day's a rat race
Verse 5
I'm about to inject you with the verbal slime
The vegetables of rhyme
Nutrition for your mind
Poke your nerves in your spine
Emcees be all over the place with their rhymes
While mine remain defined
Glued to perfection
I kiss the mic with affection
My mind is taking time for some stretching
Bending galaxies into my verbal collection
My ethics remain the most pristine
You don’t know half the shit I've seen
Drugs, violence and money ain't my scene, that shits obscene
Failure is not in my genome
I eat rappers like amino
Acid I spit, I'm sick make you need chemo
I got the heart of a king, I'm casino
I keep my profile on the d low
That way if I need to snap a neck, I can creep slow
I'm quiet but alert like Cappuccino
For every rhyme you have, I got a kilo
I torpedo my ego of being half Latino with rhymes that are jalapeño
A mean flow, like a lunch money
Bully
I got leverage like a pulley
Pull your body in the gully
Then assassinate ya subtly
Fire rhymes, I’ll boil your blood till its bubbly
I must boil your blood because I can't leave evidence
I can't have a conscious that is decadence
I'm perfecting the elements
So I can raise a hell-ish genesis
Inject ya membranous tissues
With my sentences
Your brain is my new residence
So prepare for ideas of excellence and long nights of restlessness
I'm reckless, I'll erode your skeletal with tetanus
Spit the most venomous
Leave you stranded in a nebulous
Unless you're in for my best interest
I'll show you benevolence
Fly us away on a Pegasus
Let you benefit from my intelligence
My rhymes are the perception of medicine that is perfection
Known to cure cancer, bulimia and depression
That last one is a self-tested assessment
Verse 6
I'm back with a bad habit of being a rabbit and too hop to be toe tag-ged
I'll incinerate you if you discriminately use the term faggot
Bury your skeleton inside of the slime of the maggots
That's the way its gotsta happen if you're a foul mouth bastard who thinks backwards you capsize slacker
Step into my rapture
This is chapter, one
It's do this or do a backwards gun
That last one rhymed with try
You imbecile child step into my trial
Let's see if you follow the crevices or smile
Let's see if you can decipher my rhyme style
It's gold wealth, disguised in stealth
Subliminal messages that tend to melt
Your brain it's actually not good for you health
So maybe you shouldn't listen to me
Maybe you should just do your own thing
But just know I have a swarm of bees ready to sting
Emerging, from underneath my lunula fing-ertips
Talk ya shit, I ain't allergic
In fact I'll probably learn it
Churn it, inside of the pot
Stir it
Take the recipe and burn it
Then emerge it
2.0 the newer version
And now everybody's drinking my syrup
I'm the best in the west let's not get into a stirrup
From CA through Oregon, Washington to Alberta
Chorus
Freestyle 2
(You wanna hear some words?
I don't give a fuck about a verb, or a noun, I'm profound
Sniffing out pounds of herb like a hound
I'm always at work
Spinning pizzas picture perfect round
I got a low-key sound and I'm bound
To have a Loki crown that's golden brown
Pretty girls pucker like a goldfish mouth
I’m about to get a sucker on me down south
I'm losing my marbles like change in the couch
I guess my mindset is my new allowance)
Verse 7
I elope, in these dark thoughts of a man
Reaching for the ends to which they span
I'm creeping on myself I just need the white van
Weighing actions vs. consequences by the gram
I've been blowing myself up like ‘42 japan
I'm the number one rank in any clan
And I'm just speaking frank, Anne
And I’m walking on the plank of the shark tank
My boat already sank so I'd better start to thank
Oil the gears as they crank, swivel the gun on the tank
And I'm the dope boy and this here is dank
Every song has a ploy, I come out with a shank
This ain't a toy, this the gun of a tank
This ain't a coin, this is the whole bank
I'm the dope boy, my product is dank
Verse 8
I’ll hydrate ya like hydrocortisone
I'm in my zone I’ve already flown
Migrated to Oregon
My heads a mess I need a comb
Miss my family kiss ‘em on the phone
I'm up and coming
I'm all up and grown
I’m tryna compare myself to the legend of Davy Jones
I'm in construction watch out for my orange cones
And I'm known for drinking milk so I'm not prone to broken bones
So come at me with your full blown
And problems about the O-zone
Verse 9
I came out, I came out
I came out, I came out
And when my mother came around
She said ""I hate your sound""
I thought ""Fuck you talking bout now?""
She said ""You're not brown, you didn't grow up downtown, sometimes I think you do these things just to see me frown""
I thought ""Fuck off, can't knock me down""
I'm not in this for a crown, I'm in this only for the sound
Who needs to care whether I'm black white or brown?
It's only what I say and convey that counts
I was in the pound, impounded, who let the dogs out?
I may have been lost but I came back found
With a new collar and a shiny name tag on
A whole new lawn of grass to aim and pee on
Eat sleep and play with repeat on
Barking at the mailman to be gone
Cause I don't trust the government
It seems like they're crooked and crumbling
I wanna make my paycheck and not funnel it
Back into paths where I just run a bit
People need structure but government feels fluctuated
Easily hated, but I think we'd hate it if we didn't make it
And if we didn't have laws we would all have died 100 years ago all too faded, it's undebated
Human nature is more destructive than creative
That's why you should praise me for being patient
I got a relation-
-ship with God
And he says ""Dog
It's all backwards, our spots
Responsibility in you, in knocks
You're the new boss, take it out for a shot.""
I'm shocked, for a second my heart stopped and my stomach dropped...
Me and God just flopped...
So the first thing I’mma do is smash the crown with a rock
Burn the throne, no more idols to mock
My idea of leadership is like Spock
Rid of emotion and respect the cock (Atmosphere)
Eat, sleep and fuck is what we got
Take it back to the basics of the block
I need your help so give me your hand
There's a revolution out there for us to understand
All of us create it, there's no plan
Shits been spinning the same like a fan
Let stand, and create a template to end all of what we debate
This is a race, keep your pace
Chorus
Freestyle 3
(It courses through my brain
It-it-it-it’s in my sayings
It’s every motherfucking thing that I’ve been playing
And every, I’ve been, I’ve been spraying
Running through these god damn lyrics every day in
Day in, night out
Cause I’m a dark knight right now
I’m under the moon, I’m literally on Mt. Baldy
You motherfuckers ain’t know shit about the shots that I’ve be calling
Man what the fuck am I talking about?
I’m just, I’m just high right now
I, I’m too high, I’m too high
Literally I’m like 2000 feet above, above sea level
Check my, check my fucking levels
I need to turn the gain down I sound distorted
Man my rhymes are so nice it’s like I’m imported)
Verse 10
Ayo I was six feet deep, in something that I dug
But I just pulled myself up outta that rut
I’m here to stir a muck
Bring the fuck with the ruckus
Ooh I'm so luscious
This is how many fucks I give
(……..)
Hut hut, Andrew Luck
I'm back in play
Or re le, Chez Jose
This is where I lay this is where I wanna stay
Every night every day
Blow up like Michael Bay
Actually fuck fame, that shit cray-
-fish, if you in it for the money you a bitch
I don't say this often but you can suck my dick
Egotistical pricks I turn into bowels
I'm a wild dog you want to hear me howl?
I'm like a soul on ice with the solstice at night
Insomniac werewolf with a bite
I scream for ice cream but I wouldn't do much for a Klondike
Don't believe the hype, they're just alright
(but G the motherfucker who strikes with might)
Verse 11
I got bars that’ll take me further than mars
I’ve known it from the start so I’ve been perfecting my art
Your part, is not much in my scheme
Just make sure you scream when I’m on stage
Have everybody listening
My life’s pristine
Wake up and smoke weed
Say “Hello” to the team
We just trying to get some C.R.E.A.M
Wu-Tang, who saying
That I’m playing? I’m a rap abomination
Emcee’s praying that I won’t slay ‘em
On their own beat, on their own street
And hear their mother’s weep
As I leave a card by their feet
Says “I ended the blindness, Sincerely the Finest”
Ooh-wee
I’ll always kill ‘em with kindness
Ooh-wee
I got the lyrical heat
The inferno that burns though your journal (Mos Def)
I put my sweatshirt on so that’s word to Earl
I expel pearls, I’m not talking about the necklace
I’m reckless, I’ll always eat a pussy out for breakfast
I’m next bitch, so don’t judge this dude
You don’t know what the fuck I’ve been through
Too, much has been put into this
So I ain’t leaving until I have a gold fucking necklace
Yes, I, I must spit to impress
Before I’m the next best to put the mic to rest
Mos Def, taught me mathematic tactics
Most rap is lacking
So I’ll start the reaction of (INhale) in action
That’s oxygen in action
I got L’s being passed ‘n’
I can sleep when I’m dead so for now let me rap
Verse 12
I'm leaping off cliffs to expand my wingspan
Morphing my brain into a sphere
So every angle that appears is clear
Gain the ability to sneer in the face of fear
Fear is nothing
Compared to what I've been cooking and stuffing
Inside the turkey
It's murky and doesn't understand what is mercy
It's out for blood and boy am I thirsty
Swimming in dreams of virgins and wine
Disembodied the shrine
Gave it a design
Of thought, individuality
Acts of kind with immortal minds
Death is just a race against time
To see who can accomplish what within it
Death to the men who undermined women
And I feel as if I never will die
As I can accomplish whatever I try
Apply my mind
Into the eyes and look right through the sky
My soul is as soft as the fuzz on a peach
Embodying every freak that I meet
We have more genes
Than every speck of sand on a beach
What does that mean?
Where is the gene
That makes an act of mean?
Where is the gene
That births a queen?
Where is the gene
That causes my lucid dreams?
Where is the gene that made G
The Jesus of DJ-ing
And spitting this lyrics?
(You know this shit is more than just appearance
This shit is really, it goes deep inside of my veins
It courses through my sayings)
Verse 13
It's me and my words against the world
I talk a lot so I don't need a referral
You can't unrecord, so this shit is eternal
I’m smooth with my verbal and this beat is fertile
So I fuck it, every night tuck it
Into bed, wake up she gives me head
Then puts her head on my stomach
She tells me she loves it and loves when
I unbutton what's covering her
And plummet into her muffin
Pussy so sweet
Caramel, chocolate vanilla and poppy seed
Yo I'm papa G
Word to b poppa I g
I see, hip-hop properly
I'm about to take radio rap out of poverty
Run an iPod monopoly with a free music economy
Wreck the record label my philosophy
I've overcome mountains
You got anything else that can stop me?
You best eat your broccoli
Cause you gon’ need to be real strong to stop me
Except I ain’t stopping
Chorus
Freestyle 4
(Except I ain’t stopping
You copy?
Think about what you say before you're sorry
That's why I'm old fashioned like Atari
I'm on my grind doing Ollie’s
All these raps are quality
I don't have a favorite one, I'm about equality
I'm in the trees like a koala be
I got the world's best heart, I'm fatherly
That's why all these crazy bitches want to have their fawn with me
Quit calling me, I don't wanna be bothered
You see, I've met a whole lot of you ladies
And you’re all fucking crazy
Had one girl fake a pregnancy
Expecting me to stick around
All these women try and tie me down with a baby
Ah ""Just put it in without a condom"" I've heard way too often
Followed by ""It's alright, I took the pill""
Bitch I don't trust you and that's how I feel, Ha!
I ain't amused but you're a muse for me to use
Always spew the holy holy like in the pew
I got a birds eye view and sick with my own flu
With which I might fly by and kill you
Catch that or was that too much for you?
I hope you caught it cause now your finally dead
Now I don't have to waste any lead
You're so-so but I'm every thread
And all your opinions are just things that I’ve already said)
Verse 14
My lips are always chapped
From all the air I drag
What goes in must come out and
My sentences are bad
My soul is at the end of a mag
I see a man with a bag
I look the other way, I see the man with the segregated flag
Which way do I go? What do you think?
You take me stupid or someone on the brink
Of world peace and humanity in sync
And all of this within an arms reach
So I can't blink until I find the missing link
Verse 15
21 years in the making
And the whole time I been going bacon
I think I've been pacing
I'm near my final destination
Life isn't patient
It wants what it wants and takes it
And then it sees what it wants and creates it
These are the basic rules of life
Day after night, until the end of time
So why do we fight?
What is wrong? What is right?
The only lesson I've learned is don't believe the hype
Can we even learn? Or is it just lessons that we have to earn?
Why do we yearn? Life always ends in turn
So why do I smoke the fern? Is it the INhalation of the burn?
Why do I like to curse? Why do I like to flirt?
Why do I write this verse? What really are words worth?
Do they really serve a purpose or is it getting lost in the universe?
Should I try to fly like the birds, or dig tunnels with the worms?
Why do I want these things?
Are the answers really what I search?
I'm trying to answer life before I lie in the hearse, yeah!
Verse 16
I see, I see hip-hop as a gun
It gives power to the man who yields one
But it gives a whole nother level of power to the man who really knows how to wield one
Same thing how it takes talent to go semi pro
But it takes a whole lotta work to go professional
It's a big difference
It's the big leagues vs. the amateurs
It’s the circumference vs. the diameter
The worker vs. the manager
The peasant vs. the chancellor
The black house cat vs. the panther
It's me vs. hip hops ramblers
Quit being inconsiderate
And taking away from an art form
So you can get your liquor in
That was built to make a difference
Through brutal honesty and enlightening the policies
Of what us inaudibly
To common to see
NBC, just wants gossip
I'm here in the form of the long lost prophet
Allah reincarnated with Muhammad
Serving the blood of my heart in a goblet
Knowledge of an entire life in every droplet
Flow of a faucet that's sick like vomit
That last line is a composite of a sonnet
I'm preparing to pay with my life
And my words are my breath, and wallet
Is being held under a knife
The pressure is precise
The ethics of a man I like to exercise
Experience is the best teacher of wrong vs. right
So don't believe the hype
I'm not always right despite being a white, man
I'm right because I stay up at night to write my insight until I can't feel my hand
This is something that's bigger than me
And I won't quit until I can put it in between my teeth
Verse 17
They say what I say ain't as important as what I do
But I'm confused, because what I bring to you is the same two
Hold up Steve let's sniff out the Blues Clues
This one's sweat on my neck like J. Crew
Let's sniff out the Blues Clues and take a J cruise
Chains of thought weigh like slave shoes
Not what you should see but what they choose
It's what they put on our shoes with swoosh labels
We released information over the Internet for free to anyone who was able
With cells into portable tables and cables
Chorus
Freestyle 5
(Uh, I don’t know what to say, uh
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup
I can be an emcee or I could be the drummer
I can make more sound than the engine of a Hummer
Bummer, that you have to sit the sideline
While I spit raps and ride the high rise
You need to climb a mountain just to get in my eyesight
And I can make this real messy like we was in a pie fight
That's 3.14
What’chu know about that? Nothing? Well there's the door
I suggest you still get out while it's easy like a whore
Cause if you stand there and rebuttal when I come back around there's gonna be a Whole. Lot. More.)
Verse 18
My face been multiplying acne like I'm a mathlete
I’m feeling crappy like 2015 Crabtree
I feel like a has be, so I drink coffee, until the break of dawn
While rapping, zeppelin rocking, ignorance the new armeggadon
I've had lots of time to reflect the concept of many wrongs
Addiction to electronic restriction has humanity dead and gone
Has everything I think been thought? Is it just the credits on?
Am I ever creative or just invasive like Jason Statham in The Italian Job? That's a whole different song. Pause. New topic
Verse 19
I’m watching the blur of green trees and leaves
Feeling like nothing ever mattered
I can feel the vibration through the cars tire feet
Recline and the rocks’ll start to sing you to sleep
Elevation is what we seek, the summit is under my feet
This forest is quiet no birds cheep
Fresh air meant to INhale deep
The smoke from the blunt starts to seep
Into my lungs take in the heat
Smoke on the view, gaze on the haze
Baker, I’m covered I'm fog
Crepes with a glaze
Of hazelnut gourmet sauce
Topped off with whipped bliss of the gods
Smoke smog with my dawgs
Smash, no items or mods
Not a monster but a cookie hog
I'm pretty odd, do whatever I feel when I wake up
Too many things to do than stay put and stay stuck
Add a little flavor with a spray of the shaker
I'm a creator who just gave this crater
And it's big as fuck
You could roll in its deep but it’s like the wheels on the bus
Darkness makes you ponder if the difference of life is on purpose or luck?
Why am I me and not a big buck?
Why does my head point to happiness and big bucks?
Why is my head not the shape of a duck?
What if monkeys are secretly smarter than us?
What if they're the ones running the experi-munts?
They act dump to puppeteer us with ropes
You can't understand any other life except the one yours chose
But yet all our electrons rotate so close
Created the difference between inland and coast
Dead and living folks
And the concept of hope
(Isotopes and molecules
I be running through this shit that I cule)
Verse 20
I can think
Though any situation
I got the bossest consciousness
Filled with the rawest faucet
Of flawless thoughts that blossom
Into colossal gospel
My words are fossils
Here to stay
Spread and spray
From Boston to Austin to the bay
I display an awesome buffet
Of parfaits that convey
Past clichés and will live on past my day when I pass away
I’m molding my days like clay
And churning the furnace to not decay
So preserve my DNA
Like fine cabernet
Wine
And sip it on my judgment day
Eat my words like sorbet soufflé
At my cafe
The fires crackling
My mouth is babbling
Trying to tackle what happening
Around me, but sadly
I don't think I'm scratching
The surface of the half of it
I'm passing time trying to remind
Every pacifist that they're accurate
I'm trying to ejaculate the immaculate all over your face
Make ya taste my miraculous case
I'm trying to calculate every single angle
Untangle hatred
And become the grateful patrons
Underneath those clothes we're all naked, we're all related
So let's hug each other, snap the moment and paint it
Make it a song on everybody's playlist
And label it the greatest
Chorus
Freestyle 6
(Oh you’re a fat ass? Boo-hoo
Quit going to McDonald’s and make your own fucking food
It’s not rocket science it’s not even voodoo
Don’t eat donuts motherfucker get your head right
And at night, I don’t obey the law of red lights
I do donuts what I drive, I spin around in my mind
I got the eyesight of the three blind mice times thrice
That’s nine, that’s nice, I don’t listen to Christ
I don’t like being told what not and what to do
Call me a rebel but that’s just what I’m meant to do
I’m amendable but if I led, I’d be incredible
Don’t run out of lead in your pencil
Cause my lessons’ immensful)
Verse 21
I’m on 16th alley in the Cascade valley
North of Cali
I been working out my mind like Bally
Cooking something up on the galley
Putting beats in body bags, add up the tally
My raps are pieces of art, I got a whole gallery
I can pep talk a rally into a riot for the finale
Flow sweeter than berries, like Halle
Ooh I like them caramel girls
The scandalous girls
Fuck me like an animal girls
Bring out my instincts
Make me go primate
Annihilate your eardrums
With vibrate, tions
I hydrate with nitrate
So I flow with nitrous
Let loose like on Friday night with a pipe
Packed with kief of the leaves
That allows me to catch Z's
Cause I don't sleep, Geez Louise
Nicky G, He's the missing piece of the puzzle
Between peace vs. muzzles
I paint a picture with my ease-l
I got a lot of power I need diesel
With a flow so lethal my language needs to be illegal
I got the nose of a beagle and the talons of an eagle
I turn ya into fecal then roll you around like a dung beetle
I’ll stab you with a bees needle and put you in the fetal
Position, a fucking animal on every composition
159 is the addition of my cognition
So when I'm speaking you need to shut the fuck up and listen
Just kidding
But I'm just more than a musician
I got food for thought that's nutrition
I'm a poetic dietician
And fuck paying tuition
I'd rather spray my ammunition
I'm in a high gear transmission
And I just sparked the ignition
Verse 22
I been creeping through the peep hole
Weed O's till my feet slow
Shoot a beat then I reload
Nicky G, G is for giant with my fe-fi-fe-flow
Stomp, the ground erodes
Yo he flow like he got the cheat codes
He is not an equal
King Midas touch when he flow, he speak gold
Deceitful, like Rumpelstiltskin
Like Rumpelstiltskin
Chilling with the fill in villain
I’m just your enemy until I make a killing
I’m throwing curveballs like Curt Schilling
I'm iller than a chinchilla that has ten children
Fighting off evil women like Scott Pilgrim
I swear I've met more than a million
And I don't do this for them
I do this for the feeling
I do this for the Chem-
-istry of my brain stem
Raise the mayhem
Out my cranium
Not the best
But def-
-initely in the top ten
And offend-
Ded if you think diff-er-ent
Not what I want but I spit what I am
Verse 23
I may be introverted and shy
But in my mind, Lies
A consciousness, where
I got enough confidence and competence to accomplish an entire continent
I got a horoscope of a broke metronome
I'm the holy ghost giving every note a home
I’ll straighten out your head like a comb
I'm flowing Rivers like Joan
Get girls wet like boats
I float with ease
I got a whole lotta ways to cut the cheese
I got an army of chords and keys
I breathe these raps like breeze
I got your hands up like I told you to freeze
But unlike the police, I'm pro free
I’m digging tunnels underground where the moles be
Dip me like guacamole
I'm raising all you kids like Angelina Jolie
I'm a god, on the low key
Like a bass note
I was born in the winter I'm straight cold
I’ll give you a splinter with a dull icicle
I’ll break the ice in your skull
Throw your corpse off the hull
You'll feed the seagulls
My words should be illegal I'm so lethal
I got retrieval skills like a beagle
Snatching the egg of an eagle
Which I feed my people to lead past the cathedral to laugh in the face of evil
And I won't stop until the Devil lays peaceful
And all men are treated equal
I got a sequence of sequels
This is just the prequel of the needle
Chorus
Freestyle 7
(I just smoked a blunt
My body is retarded
My mind has departed
Rolled a back and sparked it
The moon isn't even the farthest
I've traveled, through galaxies and seen through fallacies of the most lethargic
That last line was a hiccup
That last beat I made, I need to turn the kick up
Make my vocal pop because listen how I spit luck
Gain respect and get trust
Maintain flexed, Nick’s
Maintain flexed, Nick the mista
It's when the pressures on that defines who you are
Are you subpar or you can reach the bar?
Except the bar is meant to be lifted, and I'm the motherfucking gifted!
Who be spitting and kicking all of this god damn different
Things that I’ve been lifting)
Verse 24
I'm like a magician I can disappear into thin air
I brainstorm so much I wake up with Einstein’s hair
I'm in a race against a tortoise and I'm the hare
But this ain't the story you used to hear
I'm trying to rewrite history with a flare so rare
My skins so fair I can give you a ghost-like scare
But in reality I'm sweeter than a pear
With a mistook left hook that can leave you impaired
My words sting like Nair
And they slap like a snare
I rhyme snuggly like a big teddy bear
My flow spreads like a spiders web
Step into my lair
I'm making the world change, I’m not waiting like Mayer
I spend my time as a god like creator
So if music dies I can rise and be the savior
Verse 25
Ain't no limits to this gift
I'm tired of cheese and crackers I want to live the Ritz
Bliss, death has given me a kiss
But that's another story that's was some shit
Let's just say I appreciate what it means to live
I hold in my genes(jeans) my kids
And honest, I hope they never get my lisp
Money power and happiness, I can't scratch away this itch, it's a bitch
My soul could never be beat even by Chuck Norris' fists
My goal is to become a young enormous prince
My name on all the tourists’ lists
A camera click with a horde of pics
Give all the Swedish chicks a foreign dick
I feel immortal with this
Take a shot I pray it miss, cause my sleeves' got more tricks
Too many things I want to fix
I'm just a kid I eat Trix
I want to get under your skin like ticks
The clock ticks and tocks I think time is a paradox
I have too many thoughts to talk
And if you're racist, suck my cock here's a box of dicks
That last line was a little bit ridiculous
But that’s ok because I’m named Nicholas
And I try to stay fresh and packed like pickles is
I have a high ego it's hard to get with this
Victorious, of the people, my name is Nicholas
Verse 26
I'm here to steal the loot, kick the boot
I got two, truces but killed Usylluss with his own trident
I'm walking in Stride chewing Trident
I got about 5 packs of Dentyne Ices
Juicy Fruits in Orbit around Hubba Bubba and Double Mint
I chew ‘em all I don't care what the price is
Truth is, my crew chew gum or they're left lifeless
I might smite this, so tell me what the hype is
I'm hip and I hop like the bunny from Energizer
Summon my chariot I got the Christ-risen Chrysler
No more V-Techs and no more ricers
I ball all day Like Mike in a white shirt
Lurk all night ya might get hurt
Or shot by all my squads Super Soakers
Do it for fun like we was some poachers
Taxiderm your head real big like “yeah, yeah we're some big boasters”
Wake up every morning staring at it with a cup of Roasters
Chorus
Freestyle 8
(Now don't get me wrong I like ass and tits
But I'd much rather see a girls assets
If she doesn't have good morals I'll send that chick backwards
And sit back and roll a Backwood on my lips
And smoke till my lungs hiccup
Smart girls are the one’s that gets my dick up)
Verse 27
Hip-hop never died, I just woke her up with a kiss
Lashes exposed her eyes, they told me she loved her Nick
Slipped in with my dick, now I'm addicted to it
All it is, is finding new ways to lick the clit while I spit
New ways to express the messages I give
She indulges my bliss, told me “Don’t stop, don't quit
I want you to give me every last inch”
In the morning I don't split because I found my niche
She's holding a crown and I'm the fresh young prince
I won't call her a bitch, she's too precious to hit
Even is she's got blood, I'll go down like a Crip
Verse 28
I be puff-puff passing on the medical
But passing over edibles
I'm incredibly credible
My knowledge goes deep as if I got several
Minds inside my cranium
If Big Bills is closed then I'm gonna be breaking in
I’m about to eat balls cheesed to perfection
And slices known to give saliva erections
I'm just messin’ but I remain sincere with my adolescence
I ran 5 miles today gasping for breath and
Everyday I eat Oatmeal for breakfast
I'm trying to grow a mustache
But it's hard when I still act like a rug rat
It feels great in Colorado to have the sun back
I'm chasing nirvana like I run track
Yanni rolling backwoods
Smoke don't make me rap good
Time slows so much it goes backwards
It's the fountain of youth and that's word
Backwoods of fat herbs
And slaphappy rap masters
The rock I'm on makes my ass hurt
Stomach rumbling makes me want to go to the crapper
Oh wait I'm on the beat though
Sit and think about that one for a minute
I’m aiming for big game shoot and skin it
Hang the antlers to remind myself I’m driven
And I want to be livid in Bolivia
And flip all of our media
J.K. Rowling in the deep
Harry potter nerd but Adele puts me to sleep
Me and death been known to meet
Am I lucky or too grim to creep?
Piling my dreams into a heap
Then repeat through my speech
Verse 29
I used to dream about the day that I would die
But now I can't stop eating it up like pie
I got a sweet tooth for equality and love
And if you're full of hate I won't share my drugs
Addicted to lick the sweat on my upper lip
Never will I slip when I’m passionate
I've always been too cocky of myself
I held up my ego like a belt
I've had days I felt like my heart could melt
And others where all I did was puff top shelf
I can break your focus
Trick you with hocus-pocus
Bullshit ya with no bogus
Leave your Solo shot Hope-less
I see more stem and flower than florists
I'm the hour of power with a flow so enormous
Talk is cheap just show me where the smoke is
Within the universe we're all just tourists
I eat chips and churros at Torres
I got the horns of a Taurus and
I drank the potent potion of emotion in motion
Now I'm feeling like my soul was stolen
Verse 30
I don't have a DJ, it's just me
I also don't have a free day because I'm also an emcee
I hear these kids rapping about how drake got a Wusa
But what's even cooler is I can play 12 scales on a tuba
I wanna hear a jazz diss track
The battle of back-to-back saxes
Bass lines with more scales than basses
Attacking guitar axes
Piano strings springing like a mattress
Improvised not practiced
That’s why my rhymes are going down as a classic
Chorus
Freestyle 9
(Practice today makes the perfect practice tomorrow
Lessons on loan I'm living lavish on borrow
All I know is I'm living Jack-ish like Sporrow, Sparrow
Did you catch that? most don't listen…
Robert's in raves and rancers of dancers
More wrong that right? Schrute Dwight
And mama Mary made mad marvelous muffins making Martha managing maniacs maybe moping mopeing mild Mark missing memories, her enemy...
Haha, what the fuck did that even mean?
I don’t know, but it sounded heavenly
Show me someone better than me
Uh, I just smoked a Backwood, I didn’t even get that high
I got buzzed as fuck though, that Back-tobacco dry, haha
And I'm back in the woods rolling backwoods that are that good
I'm a slaphappy rap master
My favorite sound is the sound of laughter
I do unseen good deeds like I'm Casper
I've touched more lives than a badass pastor
I'm shutting on this beat I treat it like the crapper
I know too many lines to be a bad actor
I'm so much more than just a rapper
Listen to my whole album then tell me why after
And I'm just breaking the ice, this cypher’s just the fracture)
Outro
Haha, Yeah!
Goddamn that was good
Not bad for uh, eight takes?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eight takes
Who cares man? I’m high right now

I’m getting more livid in
Splitting these dividends
To everyone that be living in)
Ayy, alright
It’s like, oh shit, it’s 3:40 in the morning right now
Um, my computers’ got like eight percent battery left
Yeah, it’s time to call this quits man
But uh, I still got half an album left
I’ll see you on the other side of the moon, Disc 2
This is fun but I gotta go to bed man
Ah fuck it who am I kidding? (I’m not going to bed
I’m about to, I’m about to go home and uh
Ya know just kick more rhymes out my head
Smoke a little dope till my eyes red
Go to another planet where I can pretend)
Haha, alright I’m outta here
I got motherfucking Clips! Clips!
(Give me a beat, I’ll shoot and reload
Anytime, I’ll hit the three-point like a free throw
Yo you see me on the street, give me a word!
Ya know I don’t want you to think I’m making these freestyles with a cheat code)
Haha, alright for real
Third time’s the charm
G out, I’ll see your motherfuckers after the interlude
I got Clips!"

raindrops keep fallin' on my head,b.j. thomas,1970,1970,"Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife
And as he started to go
She said, ""Billy, keep your head low.""
Billy, don't be hero
Come back to me

The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, ""We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground.""
I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men.""
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said


I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud
He died that way
I heard she threw the letter away"
annie's song,john denver,1974,1970,"You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you
Come let me love you, come love me again
(Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again)

You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again"

Hey sexy lady
Girl, you drive me crazy
You dance so fine
And you're right on time
Girl, you're driving me out of my mind
If it wasn't for the girl
Sitting next to me

You got me hypnotized
Soul mesmo-ized
Girl, you're moving me
Girl, you're groovin' me

save the best for last,vanessa williams,1992,1990,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Like nibbling a little afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun gone down

Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down"

bed of roses,bon jovi,1993,1990,"Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails

I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

Nice and easy but there's just one thing

We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'

Don't think for a second I can't get you out them panties
I eat it till it's gone, so keep it fresh like Mannie
I done f**ked up the game before they could ask, ""can he?""
Threats on my freedom, twelve don't even wanna can me
So please get the f**k out of my way, Stanley!

They say God I'm so glad that you're home they say I hope that you're staying this time for long

Distance, I know you really miss this and we finessed everything sort of like a piss test
Kiss this, like kiss kiss, that lovey dovey, I'm sick shit, I think you need to roll out all up in my business

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block
Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved your my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Ain't nothing like the real thing.  No, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, honey
I got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can see or come to me when I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
Oooh, I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know?
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I play my game of fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together.  (Oh, oooh.)
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there
Oh
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh, Marvin.  (I know, honey.)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (So glad, so glad.)

bullets in the gun,toby keith,2011,2010,"They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea

Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die

Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun"

both sides now,judy collins,1969,1960,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feathered canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From Win and Lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"

I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?

Some peace of mind in San Jose

Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two
They’ll make you a star

And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

There’ll be a place where I can stay

I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you’re never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk"
tainted love,soft cell,1982,1980,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love"
redneck stomp,jeff foxworthy,1995,1990,"If you've ever been on television more than 5 times
Describing what the tornadoes sounded like...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever cut your grass and found a car...
You might be a redneck
If your dad walks you to school because your in the same grade...
You might be a redneck
If you've ever been too drunk to fish...
If somebody asks to see your ID and you show them your belt buckle..
If every day somebody comes to your house mistakenly thinking your having a
Yard sale
If you've ever had to haul a can of paint to the top of a water tower to defend
Your sister's honor..
You might be a redneck
If your dog and your wallet are both on a chain...
You might be a redneck
They always make fun of the way I talk, I keep telling them I said your gonna be
Real surprised when you get into the habit in St. Petersburg and say
""Y'all get into the truck, we goin up to the big house.""
If you've ever financed a tattoo....
If you've ever made change in the offering plate...
You might be a redneck
We have words in the south they don't have in other parts of the country..
Now, you come to the south, we have words like...yu'nt to
We goin to the mall, yu'nt to?
What letter does that start with, does anybody know?
I like this word alot...aight
That's a word in Texas...aight
Round lunch time every day, you'll hear somebody say
""hey jeet yet, naw, dju? Yu'nt to? Aight.""
If you go to the family reunion to meet women....
If you smoked during your wedding....
You might be a redneck

along came jones,the coasters,1959,1950,"I flopped down in my easy chair and turned on channel 2
A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was a-chasin' poor sweet Sue
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh
""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'll saw you all in half""
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He turned on the buzz saw (And then? And then?)

Tall, thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones
Commercial came on, so I got up to get myself a snack
You should've seen what was going on by the time that I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine, sweet Sue was a-havin' fits
That villain said, ""Give me the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits""
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (And then? And then?)

I got so bugged, I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was a-tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said, ""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track""
And then he grabbed her (And then?)

blue kiss,jane wiedlin,1985,1980,"A blue kiss coloring me goodbye
A new kiss could never feel so fine
Tomorrow I'll be livin in black and white
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
Red lips kissin away my fears
A blue kiss bringin me back to tears
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
Yea, these kisses are blue
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you
A prism of love surrounded us
Don't you see what our hearts knew
How can you chose a one-color world
When you know that I've got a rainbow for you
Last night a spectrum filled the sky
This morning it shattered with your goodbye
Why does it have to be such a blue kiss
When I kiss you
Now I color my world with a blue kiss
I've got kisses for you

But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't got no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next
Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
I'm ready to begin
Another chance to get further away from where I've been
But I'll never forget
Everythang I went through I appreciate the shit
Because If I hada went and took the easy way
Wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food
Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetti plus her monthly flow

They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had a lot, but thankful for
The little that I got
Why not be?
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable
(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at Tha Beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food"
she got the goldmine (i got the shaft),jerry reed,1982,1980,"Well, I guess it was back in '63
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife
Well, she said she would, so I said, ""I do""
But I'da said ""I wouldn't"" if I'da just knew
How sayin' ""I do"" was gonna screw up all of my life
Well, the first few years weren't all that bad
I'll never forget the good times we had
'Cause I'm reminded every month
When I send her the child support
Well, it wasn't too long 'til the lust all died
And I'll admit, I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said
""Goodbye, turkey, my attorney will be in touch,"" mhm
So I decided right then and there
I was gonna do what's right, give 'er her fair share
But brother, I didn't know her share was gonna be that much

She got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it right down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, it all sounds sorta funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft
Now listen, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Why, they give her the color television set
Then they give her the house
The kids and both of the cars
See?
Well, then they start talkin' about child support
Alimony, and the costs to the court
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes
Besides, everything I ever had worth takin' they've already took
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney
Askin' myself, ""Why didn't you just learn how to cook?""

They give her the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
They give me the shaft (I got the shaft)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle
But she got the better half
Well, it all sounds mighty funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

Well, she got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it all down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, I guess it all sounds funny (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ha-ha-ha)
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

Heh, heh, they ain't kidding, I got the shaft (Ooh)
But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore (Ooh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I let my wife tote it, I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps (Ooh)
You get it judge?
I'm gonna be indebted (Ooh)
That's not funny, huh?
Huh?
Contempt of court? (Ooh)
What do you mean I'm–
Listen judge, I'm just kiddin' (Ooh)
I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip, can ya? (Ha-ha-ha)"

stay real,erick sermon,1993,1990,"It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin'
Flexin no half steppin
When I release the funky weapon
Like Ricochet ping ping ping
I make fans fell it even when I sing
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berenger in Platoon
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
Whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
Who ain't down with the format
When you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
That's wack
You trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee
And then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
And then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
You lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in
From the Smith and Wessons
Change the out look
Change the cover of the book
You hip hop crook and give back what you took
It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya
Boy stay real
You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

It's on again, yeah, about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend, just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music
The fronting, you can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not, I could kill you man
For being false, plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous
Because I've been here since Strictly Business
The era of Eric B. and Rakim, Biz
Public Enemy, Run-DMC, Whodini
The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
LL, when he was rockin bells
Sucker, which fake emcee is rearranging the structure
Ban the motherfucker
And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind
So stay real
You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up

Yes, I'm back, Black, for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of an MC hardcore style type of human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know? Because MTV shows it
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots, the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees
And wannabes that's worst than the AIDS disease
So wake up like a Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead, get to the point (word 'em up)
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom!
Peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic
The only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real

You better wake up and smell the coffee
(Stay real)
You better wake up
Peace, and I;m outta here

I wish no one in my place

And I've seen
You don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep

I can't stay
In this place
I can't stand
When the room turns round
On my fate
You give no guarantees
There's no promise
I can keep
I can't stand
I can't see my way
I feel blind
On my feet
I can't stay too long
Am I wrong?

Goodbye, lay the blame on luck

I'm so tired
Of my mood
And sleep comes
With a knife, fork and a spoon
You're so pale
In your face
You let life
Get in your way

Am I wrong?

Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday

And Cap what you doin?

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never
Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days

So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
Cause that's about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean, vicious woman)
Every day 'for suppertime, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman)
(Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)
Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons
Out of my truck patch

Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

What would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (Yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)

What would I be without you? (Uh)

I know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)
Since we met, it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon' cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love, you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
'Cause every thug needs a lady (Yeah, yeah)
I feel you, baby, 'cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears, there be no more crying (Baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl, put it on me

What would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (Yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone
Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo
Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone
And rose, my rose of San Antone"

I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone
I got no rest when I'm feeling weary
I got to pack my bags and go
I got to be somewhere tomorrow
To smile and do my show

doctor my eyes,jackson browne,1972,1970,"Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?"

I felt fine

She said theyre leaving

Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun

Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)

Daydream about the night before

In me they see a brand new man
I give you props and tell them that
My shorty's bout it
She personifies the love she gives

set the night to music,roberta flack ,1991,1990,"Set the night to music
Set the night to music
Look at all the stars tonight, look at all the moonlight
Look at us we're all alone
Oh and it's just like a dream, some romantic fantasy
Darling come and hold, hold me close
We could be making love
And with the slightest touch
We could, set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music
Find a rhythm all our own, melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here
Your heart beating next to mine, perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world disappear
This moment is ours to take (this moment is ours)
And with the love we make
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music

can i change my mind,tyrone davis,1969,1960,"Aww, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl
She fooled me this time
She acted like I was
The last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind
As I took those steps
Toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would
Make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind
Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
But, ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep looking back but
My baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind"
cat's in the cradle,ugly kid joe,1993,1990,"My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""
""I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
""You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah""
""You know I'm gonna be like him""
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""
""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

damn i wish i was your lover,sophie b. hawkins,1992,1990,"That old dog has chained you up all right
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you
Come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good
Don't say you'll stay
'Cause then you go away
Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks
For me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother

patches,clarence carter,1970,1970,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule
So every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through
'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""
Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
I could still hear papa when he's saying:
""Patches, I'm depending on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you"""

When I used to play shoot 'em up
(Shoot 'em up, bang, bang, baby)
I remember
When I chased the girls and beat 'em up
But I was young and didn't understand
But now I'm a grownup man
I know girls are made for kissing
Never knew what I was missing
Now my life is not the same
My whole world has been rearranged
I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did (Shoot 'em up, bang, bang)
(Cowboys to girls)
I remember (I remember)
When I used to see you jumping rope
(Jumpin' rope, up and down, baby)
And I remember
When you got your first baby coach
But you were young and didn't understand
Now you're a woman and I'm a man
And it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our lives are not the same
Our whole world has been rearranged
You went from (Baby dolls to boys)
Oh, yes, you did (Jumpin' rope, baby)

she's a fool,lesley gore,1963,1960,"She dunno that she's a lucky girl
Got the best thing in the whole wide world
Got a love that's hard to find
But the boy I wish was mine

She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel

He dunno it but she cheats on him
With a boy like that, it's such a sin
I would never be untrue
I would never make him blue


I know there's gonna come a day
He will tell the girl, 'Be on your way,'
Maybe then he'll turn to me
Then how happy I will be that"
paper roses,anita bryant,1960,1960,"I realize the way your eyes deceived me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of
Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart
Paper roses

Oh how real those roses seem to be

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby
(Black, black widow, baby)

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh
You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)

Be amazed at the friends you have here on your trip
Ride captain ride upon your mystery ship
On your way to a world that others might have missed
Ride, captain ride upon your mystery ship
Be amazed at the friends you have here on your trip

The way my broken heart is hurtin' me

All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
Rain drops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain

don't cry daddy,elvis presley,1970,1970,"Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out, ringing in my ears

Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight"

Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood

When I'm watchin' the world's trends
I never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
There's been some guys with some lassos
Visiting a mountain who's back broke
But someone else found true love again:
Hugh Hefner says he has three new girlfriends
And the networks now are so bold
That Snoop will probably get his own show
And I'm afraid I might tune in
Find Donald Trump and Rosie fightin' Hulk Hogan
I'm used to Ludacris but land sakes
Man, now there's filthy Justin Timberlake
And that Akon rap guy don't know what love is
There's kids developing a fan base
Meetin' total strangers out on MySpace
I know that's fun but if I had a new daughter or son
I would still not let 'em play with a gun

There's been some wild scenes in Borat
And it's kinda hard to ignore that
But that Nativity movie they made it was well done
Though the girl that was playing the Virgin wasn't one
And I know you heard some bad talk
About those girls the Pussycat Dolls
But they're tryin' to fix the unemployment rate
By themselves, find some ladies they can train
I know DaVinci Code is jive, though
It seems as if America don't think so
If that you ain't up on that then go get plugged in
Ain't gonna read their family Bible
But I know they've seen the Family Guy though
And we've told 'em before
They oughta know there's a wolf pack at the door
They should be practicing the art of war, drawn swords, but
Nah, na, na, na, na, na
CHORUS
Girls gone-a wild and I think that most teens now
And dirty old men find it fun (I'm not one)
We've got guys who'll probably go to ""Saw 5""
And say it wasn't even scary (Man, I'm serious)
We've got sources insistin' that sports is infested
With guys who cheat to try and grow strong (so prove 'em wrong)
We've got the crudest gags I've ever heard
I've seen comedians go a full hour (and not say a nice word)
And we could still perish any moment
And yet we joke about the future like it's Dave and Conan
Call me dumb, call me nuts, call me chump
So what, you'd better shout it
'Cause everyone is goin' to sleep and this is why I'm hot about it
2 Timothy 3:1-5
But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days
People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive
Disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love
Unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good
Treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
Having a form of godliness but denying it's power
Have nothing to do with them"

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
The night-time shadows disappear

But stop your cryin' when the birds sing

But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain

Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades

And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare

We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Guilt, Bad Conscience, and Related Matters
1
To breed an animal that is entitled to make promises—is that not precisely the paradoxical task nature has set itself where human beings are concerned? Isn’t that the real problem of human beings? . . . The fact that this problem has to a great extent been solved must seem all the more astonishing to a person who knows how to appreciate fully the power which works against this promise-making, namely forgetfulness. Forgetfulness is not merely a vis interiae , as superficial people think. Is it much rather an active capability to repress, something positive in the strongest sense, to which we can ascribe the fact that while we are digesting what we alone live through and experience and absorb into ourselves (we could call the process mental ingestion ), we are conscious of what is going  on as little as we are with the entire thousand-fold process which our bodily nourishment goes through (so-called physical ingestion ). The doors and windows of consciousness are shut temporarily; they remain undisturbed by the noise and struggle with which the underworld of our functional organs keeps working for and against one another; a little stillness, a little tabula rasa  of the consciousness, so that there will again be room for something new, above all, for the nobler functions and officials, for ruling, thinking ahead, determining what to do (for our organism is arranged as an oligarchy)—that is, as I said, the use of active forgetfulness, a porter at the door, so to speak, a custodian of psychic order, quiet, etiquette.  From that we can see at once how, if forgetfulness were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic (and not just compare)—he is “finished” with nothing. . . . Now, this particular animal, which is necessarily forgetful, in which forgetfulness is present as a force, as a form of strong health, has had an opposing capability bred into it, a memory, with the help of which, in certain cases, forgetfulness will cease to function—that is, for those cases where promises are to be made. This is in no way a merely passive inability ever to be rid of an impression once it has been etched into the mind, nor is it merely indigestion over a word one has pledged at a particular time  and which one can no longer be over and done with. No, it’s an active wish not to be free of the matter again, an ongoing and continuing desire for what one willed at a particular time, a real memory of one’s will, so that between the original “I will,” “I will do,” and the actual discharge of the will, its action, a world of strange new things, circumstances, even acts of the will can be interposed without a second thought and not break this long chain of the will. But how much all that presupposes! In order to organize the future in this manner, human beings must have first learned to separate necessary events from chance events, to think in terms of cause and effect, to see distant events as if they were present, to anticipate them, to set goals and the means to reach them with certainty, to develop a capability for figures and calculations in general—and for that to occur, a human being must necessarily have first himself become something one could predict, something bound by regular rules, even in the way he imagined himself to himself, so that finally he is able to act like someone who makes promises—he can make himself into a pledge for the future!
2
Precisely that development is the long history of the origin of responsibility. That task of breeding an animal which is permitted to make promises contains within it, as we have already grasped, as a condition and prerequisite, the more precise task of first making a human being necessarily uniform to some extent, one among others like him, regular and consequently predictable. The immense task involved in this, what I have called the “morality of custom” (cf. Daybreak 9, 14, 16)—the essential work of a man on his own self in the longest-lasting age of the human race, his entire prehistorical work, derives its meaning, its grand justification, from the following point, no matter how much hardship, tyranny, monotony, and idiocy it also manifested: with the help of the morality of custom and the social strait jacket, the human being was made truly predictable. Let’s position ourselves, by contrast, at the end of this immense process, in the place where the tree at last yields its fruit, where society and the morality of custom finally bring to light the end for which they were simply the means: then we find, as the ripest fruit on that tree, the sovereign individual, something which resembles only itself, which has broken loose again from the morality of custom, the autonomous individual beyond morality (for “autonomous” and “moral” are mutually exclusive terms), in short, the human being who possesses his own independent and enduring will, who is entitled to make promises—and in him a consciousness quivering in every muscle, proud of what has finally been achieved and has become a living embodiment in him, a real consciousness of power and freedom, a feeling of completion for human beings generally. This man who has become free, who really is entitled to make promises, this master of free will, this sovereign—how is he not to realize the superiority he enjoys over everything which is not permitted to make a promise and make pledges on its own behalf, knowing how much trust, how much fear, and how much respect he creates—he “is worthy” of all three—and how, with this mastery over himself, he has necessarily been given in addition mastery over his circumstances, over nature, and over all less reliable creatures with a shorter will? The “free” man, the owner of an enduring unbreakable will, by possessing this, also acquires his own standard of value: he looks out from himself at others and confers respect or contempt. And just as it will be necessary for him to honour those like him, the strong and dependable (who are entitled to make promises)—in other words, everyone who makes promises like a sovereign, seriously, rarely, and slowly, who is sparing with his trust, who honours another when he does trust, who gives his word as something reliable, because he knows he is strong enough to remain upright even when opposed by misfortune, even when “opposed by fate”—in just the same way it will be necessary for him to keep his foot ready to kick the scrawny unreliable men, who make promises without being entitled to, and to hold his cane ready for the liar, who breaks his word in the very moment it comes out of his mouth. The proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of responsibility, the consciousness of this rare freedom, of this power over oneself and destiny, has become internalized into the deepest parts of him and grown instinctual, has become an instinct, a dominating instinct:—what will he call it, this dominating instinct, assuming that he finds he needs a word for it? There’s no doubt: the sovereign man calls this instinct his conscience.
3
His conscience? . . . To begin with, we can conjecture that the idea “conscience,” which we are encountering here in its highest, almost perplexing form, has a long history and changing developmental process behind it already. To be entitled to pledge one’s word, and to do it with pride, and also to be permitted to say “Yes” to oneself—that is a ripe fruit, as I have mentioned, but it is also a late fruit:—for what a long stretch of time this fruit must have hung tart and sour on the tree! And for an even much longer time it was impossible to see any such fruit—no one could have promised it would appear, even if everything about the tree was certainly getting ready for it and growing in that very direction!—“How does one create a memory for the human animal? How does one stamp something like that into this partly dull, partly flickering, momentary understanding, this living embodiment of forgetfulness, so that it stays current?” . . .  This ancient problem, as you can imagine, was not resolved right away with tender answers and methods. Indeed, there is perhaps nothing more fearful and more terrible in the entire prehistory of human beings than the technique for developing his memory. “We burn something in so that it remains in the memory. Only something which never ceases to cause pain remains in the memory”—that is a leading principle of the most ancient (unfortunately also the longest) psychology on earth. We might even say that everywhere on earth nowadays where there is still solemnity, seriousness, mystery, and gloomy colours in the lives of men and people, something of that terror continues its work, the fear with which in earlier times everywhere on earth people made promises, pledged their word, made a vow. The past, the longest, deepest, most severe past, breathes on us and surfaces in us when we become “solemn.” When the human being considered it necessary to make a memory for himself, it never happened without blood, martyrs, and sacrifices, the most terrible sacrifices and pledges (among them the sacrifice of the first born), the most repulsive self-mutilations (for example, castration), the cruellest forms of ritual in all the religious cults (and all religions are in their deepest foundations systems of cruelty)—all that originates in that instinct which discovered in pain the most powerful means of helping to develop the memory. In a certain sense all asceticism belongs here: a couple of ideas are to be made indissoluble, omnipresent, unforgettable, “fixed,” in order to hypnotize the entire nervous and intellectual system through these “fixed ideas”—and the ascetic procedures and forms of life are the means whereby these ideas are freed from jostling around with all the other ideas, in order to make them “unforgettable.” The worse humanity’s “memory” was, the more terrible its customs have always appeared. The harshness of the laws of punishment, in particular, provide a standard for measuring how much trouble people went to in order to triumph over forgetfulness and to maintain a present awareness of a few primitive demands of social living together for this slave of momentary feelings and desires. We Germans certainly do not think of ourselves as an especially cruel and hard-hearted people, even less as particularly careless people who live only in the present. But just take a look at our old penal code in order to understand how much trouble it takes on this earth to breed a “People of Thinkers” (by that I mean the European people among whom today we still find a maximum of trust, seriousness, tastelessness, and practicality, and who, with these characteristics, have a right to breed all sorts of European mandarins). These Germans have used terrible means to make themselves a memory in order to attain mastery over their vulgar basic instincts and their brutal crudity: think of the old German punishments, for example, stoning (—the legend even lets the mill stone fall on the head of the guilty person), breaking on the wheel (the most characteristic invention and specialty of the German genius in the realm of punishment!), impaling on a stake, ripping people apart or stamping them to death with horses (“quartering”), boiling the criminal in oil or wine (still done in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries), the well-loved practice of flaying (“cutting flesh off in strips”), carving flesh out of the chest, and probably covering the offender with honey and leaving him to the flies in the burning sun. With the help of such images and procedures people finally retained five or six “I will not’s” in the memory, and, so far as these precepts were concerned, they gave their word in order to live with the advantages of society—and it’s true! With the assistance of this sort of memory people finally came to “reason”!—Ah, reason, seriousness, mastery over emotions, this whole gloomy business called reflection, all these privileges and showpieces of human beings: how expensive they were! How much blood and horror is at the bottom of all “good things”! . . .
4
But then how did that other “gloomy business,” the consciousness of guilt, the whole “bad conscience” come into the world?—And with this we turn back to our genealogists of morality. I’ll say it once more—or have I not said anything about it yet?—they are useless. With their own merely “modern” experience extending through only a brief period , with no knowledge of and no desire to know the past, even less a historical instinct, a “second sight”— something necessary at this very point—they nonetheless pursue the history of morality. That must justifiably produce results which have a less than tenuous relationship to the truth. Have these genealogists of morality up to now allowed themselves to dream, even remotely, that, for instance, that major moral principle “guilt”  derived its origin from the very materialistic idea “debt” ? Or that punishment developed as a repayment, completely without reference to any assumption about freedom or lack of freedom of the will?—and did so, by contrast, to the point where it always first required a high degree of human development so that the animal “man” began to make those much more primitive distinctions between “intentional,” “negligent,” “accidental,” “responsible,” and their opposites and bring them to bear when meting out punishment? That idea, nowadays so trite, apparently so natural, so unavoidable, which has even had to serve as the explanation how the feeling of justice in general came into existence on earth, “The criminal deserves punishment because he could have acted otherwise,” this idea is, in fact, an extremely late achievement, indeed, a sophisticated form of human judgment and decision making. Anyone who moves this idea back to the beginnings is sticking his coarse fingers inappropriately into the psychology of older humanity. For the most extensive period of human history, punishment was certainly not meted out because people held the instigator of evil responsible for his actions, and thus it was not assumed that only the guilty party should be punished:—it was much more as it still is now when parents punish their children out of anger over some harm they have suffered, anger vented on the perpetrator—but anger restrained and modified through the idea that every injury has some equivalent and that compensation for it could, in fact, be paid out, even if that is through the pain of the perpetrator. Where did this primitive, deeply rooted, and perhaps by now ineradicable idea derive its power, the idea of an equivalence between punishment and pain? I have already given away the answer: in the contractual relationship between creditor and debtor, which is, in general, as ancient as the idea of “legal subject” and which, for its part, refers back to the basic forms of buying, selling, bartering, trading, and exchanging goods.
5
It’s true that recalling this contractual relationship arouses, as we might initially expect from what I have observed above, all sorts of suspicion of and opposition to older humanity, which established or allowed it. It’s at this particular moment that people make promises. At this very point the pertinent issue is to create a memory for the person who makes a promise, so that precisely here, we can surmise, there will exist a place for harshness, cruelty, and pain. In order to inspire trust in his promise to pay back, in order to give his promise a guarantee of its seriousness and sanctity, in order to impress on his own conscience the idea of paying back as a duty, an obligation, the debtor, by virtue of a contract, pledges to the creditor, in the event that he does not pay, something else that he still “owns,” something else over which he still exercises power, for example, his body or his woman or his freedom or even his life (or, under certain religious conditions, even his blessedness, the salvation of his soul, finally even his peace in the grave, as was the case in Egypt, where the dead body of the debtor even in the tomb found no peace from the creditor—and among the Egyptians, in particular, such peace certainly mattered). That means that the creditor could inflict all kinds of ignominy and torture on the body of the debtor, for instance, slice off the body as much as seemed appropriate for the size of the debt:—and this point of view early on and everywhere gave rise to precise, sometimes horrific estimates going into the smallest detail, legally established estimates about individual limbs and body parts. I consider it already a step forward, as evidence of a freer conception of the law, something which calculates more grandly, a more Roman idea of justice, when Rome’s Twelve Tables of Laws decreed it was all the same, no matter how much or how little the creditor cut off in such cases: “let it not be thought a crime if they cut off more or less.”* Let us clarify for ourselves the logic of this whole method of compensation—it is weird enough. The equivalency is given in this way: instead of an advantage making up directly for the harm (hence, instead of compensation in gold, land, possessions of some sort or another), the creditor is given a kind of pleasure as repayment and compensation—the pleasure of being allowed to discharge his power on a powerless person without having to think about it, the delight in “de fair le mal pour le plaisir de le faire” , the enjoyment of violation. This enjoyment is more highly prized the lower and baser the creditor stands in the social order, and it can easily seem to him a delicious mouthful, in fact, a foretaste of a higher rank. By means of the “punishment” of the debtor, the creditor participates in a right belonging to the masters. Finally he also for once comes to the lofty feeling of despising a being as someone “beneath him,” as someone he is entitled to mistreat—or at least, in the event that the real force of punishment, of executing punishment, has already been transferred to the “authorities,” the feeling of seeing the debtor despised and mistreated. The compensation thus consists of an order for and a right to cruelty.
6
In this area, that is, in the laws of obligation, the world of the moral concepts “guilt,” “conscience,” “duty,” and “sanctity of obligation” has its origin—its beginning, like the beginning of everything great on earth, was watered thoroughly and for a long time with blood. And can we not add that this world deep down has never again been completely free of a certain smell of blood and torture—(not even with old Kant whose categorical imperative stinks of cruelty)? In addition, here that weird knot linking the ideas of “guilt and suffering,” which perhaps has become impossible to undo, was first knit together. Let me pose the question once more: to what extent can suffering be a compensation for “debts”? To the extent that making someone suffer provides the highest degree of pleasure, to the extent that the person hurt by the debt, in exchange for the injury as well as for the distress caused by the injury, got an extraordinary offsetting pleasure: creating suffering—a real celebration, something that, as I’ve said, was valued all the more, the greater it contradicted the rank and social position of the creditor. I have been speculating here, for it’s difficult to see through to the foundations of such subterranean things, quite apart from the fact that it’s embarrassing. And anyone who crudely throws into the middle of all this the idea of “revenge” has buried and dimmed his insights rather than illuminated them (—revenge itself, in fact, simply takes us back to the same problem: “How can making someone suffer give us a feeling of satisfaction?”). It seems to me that the delicacy and, even more, the Tartufferie  of tame house pets (I mean modern man, I mean us) resist imagining with all our power how much cruelty contributes to the great celebratory joy of older humanity, as, in fact, an ingredient mixed into almost all their enjoyments and, from another perspective, how naive, how innocent, their need for cruelty appears, how they fundamentally think of its particular “disinterested malice” (or to use Spinoza’s words, the sympathia malevolens ) as a normal human characteristic:—and hence as something to which their conscience says a heartfelt Yes!* A more deeply penetrating eye might still notice, even today, enough of this most ancient and most fundamental celebratory human joy. In Beyond Good and Evil, 229 (even earlier in Daybreak, 18, 77, 113), I pointed a cautious finger at the constantly growing spiritualization and “deification” of cruelty, which runs through the entire history of higher culture (and, in a significant sense, even constitutes that culture). In any case, it’s not so long ago that people wouldn’t think of an aristocratic wedding and folk festival in the grandest style without executions, tortures, or something like an auto-da-fé , and similarly no noble household lacked creatures on whom people could vent their malice and cruel taunts without a second thought (—remember, for instance, Don Quixote at the court of the duchess; today we read all of Don Quixote with a bitter taste on the tongue; it’s almost an ordeal. In so doing, we would become very foreign, very obscure to the author and his contemporaries—they read it with a fully clear conscience as the most cheerful of books. They almost died laughing at it). Watching suffering makes people feel good; creating suffering makes them feel even better—that’s a harsh principle, but an old, powerful, and human, all-too-human major principle, which, by the way, even the apes might perhaps agree with as well. For people say that, in thinking up bizarre cruelties, the apes already anticipate a great many human actions and are, as it were, an “audition.” Without cruelty there is no celebration: that’s what the oldest and longest human history teaches us—and with punishment, too, there is so much celebration!
7
With these ideas, by the way, I have no desire whatsoever to give our pessimists grist for their discordant mills grating with weariness of life. On the contrary, I want to state very clearly that in that period when human beings had not yet become ashamed of their cruelty, life on earth was happier than it is today, now that we have our pessimists. The darkening of heaven over men’s heads has always increased alarmingly in proportion to the growth of human beings’ shame before human beings. The tired, pessimistic look, the mistrust of the riddle of life, the icy denial stemming from disgust with life—these are not the signs of the wickedest eras of human beings. It’s much more the case that they first come to light as the swamp plants they are when the swamp to which they belong is there—I mean the sickly mollycoddling and moralizing, thanks to which the animal “man” finally learns to feel shame about all his instincts. On his way to becoming an “angel” (not to use a harsher word here), man cultivated for himself that upset stomach and that furry tongue which not only made the joy and innocence of the animal repulsive but also made life itself distasteful:—so that now and then he stands there before himself, holds his nose, and with Pope Innocent III disapproves and makes a catalogue of his nastiness (“conceived in filth, disgustingly nourished in his mother’s body, developed out of evil material stuff, stinking horribly, a secretion of spit, urine, and excrement”).* Now, when suffering always has to march out as the first among the arguments against existence, as its most serious question mark, it’s good for us to remember the times when people judged things the other way around, because they couldn’t do without making people suffer and saw a first-class magic  in it, a really tempting enticement for living.  Perhaps, and let me say this as a consolation for the delicate, at that time pain did not yet hurt as much as it does nowadays. That at least could be the conclusion of a doctor who had treated a Negro (taking the latter as a representative of prehistorical man) for a bad case of inner inflammation, which drives the European, even one with the best constitution, almost to despair, but which does not have the same effect on the Negro. (The graph of the human sensitivity to pain seems in fact to sink down remarkably and almost immediately after one has moved beyond the first ten thousand or ten million of the top members of the higher culture. And I personally have no doubt that, in comparison with one painful night of a single hysterical well-educated female, the total suffering of all animals which up to now have been interrogated by the knife in search of scientific answers is simply not worth considering). Perhaps it is even permissible to concede the possibility that that pleasure in cruelty does not really need to have died out. It would only require a certain sublimation and subtlety, in proportion to the way pain hurts more nowadays; in other words, it would have to appear translated into the imaginative and spiritual and embellished with nothing but names so unobjectionable that they arouse no suspicion in even the most delicate hypocritical conscience (“tragic pity” is one  such name; another is “les nostalgies de la croix” ). What truly enrages people about suffering is not the suffering itself, but the meaninglessness of suffering. But neither for the Christian, who has interpreted into suffering an entire secret machinery for salvation, nor for the naive men of older times, who understood how to interpret all suffering in relation to the spectator or to the person inflicting the suffering, was there generally any such meaningless suffering. In order for the hidden, undiscovered, unwitnessed suffering to be removed from the world and for people to be able to deny it honestly, they were then almost compelled to invent gods and intermediate beings at all levels, high and low—briefly put, something that also roamed in hidden places, that also looked into the darkness, and that would not readily permit an interesting painful spectacle to escape its attention. For with the help of such inventions life then understood and has always understood how to justify itself by a trick, how to justify its “evil.” Nowadays perhaps it requires other helpful inventions for that purpose (for example, life as riddle, life as a problem of knowledge). “Every evil a glimpse of which edifies a god is justified”: that’s how the prehistorical logic of feeling rang out—and was that really confined only to prehistory? The gods conceived of as friends of cruel spectacle—O how widely this primitive idea still rises up even within our European humanity! We might well seek advice from, say, Calvin and Luther on this point. At any rate it is certain that even the Greeks knew of no more acceptable snack to offer their gods to make them happy than the joys of cruelty. With what sort of expression, do you think, did Homer allow his gods to look down on the fates of men? What final sense was there basically in the Trojan War and similar tragic terrors? We cannot entertain the slightest doubts about this: they were intended as celebrations for the gods: and, to the extent that the poet is in these matters more “godlike” than other men, as festivals for the poets as well. . . . Later the Greek moral philosophers in the same way imagined the eyes of god no differently, still looking down on the moral struggles, on heroism and the self-mutilation of the virtuous: the “Hercules of duty” was on a stage, and he knew he was there. Without someone watching, virtue for this race of actors was something entirely inconceivable. Surely such a daring and fateful philosophical invention, first made for Europe at that time, the invention of the “free will,” of the absolutely spontaneous nature of human beings in matters of good and evil, was created above all to justify the idea that the interest of gods in men, in human virtue, could never run out? On this earthly stage there was never to be any lack of really new things, really unheard of suspense, complications, catastrophes. A world conceived of as perfectly deterministic would have been predictable to the gods and therefore also soon boring for them—reason enough for these friends of the gods, the philosophers, not to ascribe such a deterministic world to their gods! All of ancient humanity is full of sensitive consideration for “the spectator,” for a truly public, truly visible world, which did not know how to imagine happiness without dramatic performances and festivals. And, as I have already said, in great punishment there is also so much celebration!
8
To resume the path of our enquiry, the feeling of guilt, of personal obligation has, as we saw, its origin in the oldest and most primitive personal relationship there is, in the relationship between seller and buyer, creditor and debtor. Here for the first time one person moved up against another person, here an individual measured himself against another individual. We have found no civilization still at such a low level that something of this relationship is not already perceptible. To set prices, to measure values, to think up equivalencies, to exchange things—that preoccupied man’s very first thinking to such a degree that in a certain sense it’s what thinking itself is. Here the oldest form of astuteness was bred; here, too, we can assume are the first beginnings of man’s pride, his feeling of pre-eminence in relation to other animals. Perhaps our word “man” (manas) continues to express directly something of this feeling of the self: the human being describes himself as a being which assesses values, which values and measures, as the “inherently calculating animal.” Selling and buying, together with their psychological attributes, are even older than the beginnings of any form of social organizations and groupings; out of the most rudimentary form of personal legal rights the budding feeling of exchange, contract, guilt, law, duty, and compensation was instead first transferred to the crudest and earliest social structures (in their relationships with similar social structures), along with the habit of comparing power with power, of measuring, of calculating. The eye was now adjusted to this perspective, and with that awkward consistency characteristic of thinking in more ancient human beings, hard to get started but then inexorably moving forward in the same direction, people soon reached the great generalization: “Each thing has its price, everything can be paid off”—the oldest and most naive moral principle of justice, the beginning of all “good nature,” all “fairness,” all “good will,” all “objectivity” on earth. Justice at this first stage is good will among those approximately equal in power to come to terms with each other, to “come to an agreement” again with each other by compensation—and in relation to those less powerful, to compel them to arrive at some settlement among themselves.—
9
Always measured by the standard of prehistory (a prehistory which, by the way, is present at all times or is capable of returning), the community also stands in relation to its members in that important basic relationship of the creditor to his debtor. People live in a community. They enjoy the advantages of a community (and what advantages they are! Nowadays we sometimes underestimate them); they live protected, cared for, in peace and trust, without worries concerning certain injuries and enmities from which the man outside the community, the “man without peace,” is excluded—a German understands what “misery”  or êlend  originally means—and how people pledged themselves to and entered into obligations with the community bearing in mind precisely these injuries and enmities.  What will happen with an exception to this case? The community, the defrauded creditor, will see that it gets paid as well as it can—on that people can rely. The issue here is least of all the immediate damage which the offender has caused. Setting this to one side, the lawbreaker  is above all a “breaker” , a breaker of contracts and a breaker of his word against the totality, with respect to all the good features and advantages of the communal life in which, up to that point, he has had a share. The lawbreaker is a debtor who does not merely not pay back the benefits and advances given to him, but who even attacks his creditor. So from this point on not only does he forfeit, as is reasonable, all these good things and benefits—but he is also now reminded what these good things are all about. The anger of the injured creditor, the community, gives him back again to the wild outlawed condition, from which he was earlier protected. It pushes him away from itself—and now every form of hostility can vent itself on him. At this stage of cultural behaviour “punishment” is simply the copy, the mimus, of the normal conduct towards the hated, disarmed enemy  who has been thrown down, who has forfeited not only all legal rights and protection but also all mercy; hence it is a case of the rights of war and the victory celebration of vae victis  in all its ruthlessness and cruelty:—which accounts for the fact that war itself (including the warlike cult of sacrifice) has given us all the forms in which punishment has appeared in history.
10
As it acquires more power, a community no longer considers the crimes of the single individual so serious, because it no longer is entitled to consider him as dangerous and unsettling for the existence of the totality as much as it did before. The wrongdoer is no longer “outlawed” and thrown out, and the common anger is no longer permitted to vent itself on him without restraint to the same extent as earlier— instead the wrongdoer from now on is carefully protected by the community against this anger, especially from that of the immediately injured person, and is taken into protective custody. The compromise with the anger of those particularly affected by the wrong doing, and thus the effort to localize the case and to avert a wider or even a general participation and unrest, the attempts to find equivalents and to settle the whole business (the compositio), above all the desire, appearing with ever-increasing clarity, to consider every crime as, in some sense or other, capable of being paid off, and thus, at least to a certain extent, to separate the criminal and his crime from each other—those are the characteristics stamped more and more clearly on the further development of criminal law. If the power and the self-confidence of a community keep growing, the criminal law also grows constantly milder. Every weakening and deeper jeopardizing of the community brings its harsher forms of criminal law to light once again. The “creditor” has always became proportionally more humane as he has become richer. Finally the amount of his wealth even becomes measured by how much damage he can sustain without suffering from it. It would not be impossible to imagine a society with a consciousness of its own power which allowed itself the most privileged luxury which it can have—letting its criminals go without punishment. “Why should I really bother about my parasites?” it could then say. “May they live and prosper; for that I am still sufficiently strong!” . . . Justice, which started with “Everything is capable of being paid for; everything must be paid off” ends at that point, by shutting its eyes and letting the person incapable of payment go free—it ends, as every good thing on earth ends, by doing away with itself. This self-negation of justice: we know what a beautiful name it calls itself—mercy. It goes without saying that mercy remains the privilege of the most powerful man, or even better, his beyond the law.
11
A critical comment here about a recently published attempt to find the origin of justice in a completely different place—that is, in ressentiment. But first a word in the ear of the psychologists, provided that they have any desire to study ressentiment itself up close for once: this plant grows most beautifully nowadays among anarchists and anti-Semites; in addition, it blooms, as it always has, in hidden places, like the violet, although it has a different fragrance.* And since like always has to emerge necessarily from like, it is not surprising to see attempts coming forward again from just such circles, as they have already done many times before—see above, Section 14 —to sanctify revenge under the name of justice—as if justice were basically only a further development of a feeling of being injured—and to bring belated honour to reactive emotions generally, all of them, using the idea of revenge. With this last point I personally take the least offence. It even seems to me a service, so far as the entire biological problem is concerned (in connection with which the worth of those emotions has been underestimated up to now). The only thing I am calling attention to is the fact that it is the very spirit of ressentiment out of which this new emphasis on scientific fairness grows (which favours hate, envy, resentment, suspicion, rancour, and revenge). This “scientific fairness,” that is, ceases immediately and gives way to tones of mortal enmity and prejudice as soon as it deals with another group of emotions which, it strikes me, have a much higher biological worth than those reactive ones and which therefore have earned the right to be scientifically assessed and respected first—namely, the truly active emotions, like desire for mastery, acquisitiveness, and so on (E. Dühring, The Value of Life: A Course in Philosophy, the whole book really).* So much against this tendency in general. But in connection with Dühring’s single principle that we have to seek the homeland of justice in the land of the reactive feeling, we must, for love of the truth, rudely turn this around by setting out a different principle: the last territory to be conquered by the spirit of justice is the land of the reactive emotions! If it is truly the case that the just man remains just even towards someone who has injured him (and not merely cold, moderate, strange, indifferent: being just is always a positive attitude), if under the sudden attack of personal injury, ridicule, and suspicion, the gaze of the lofty, clear objectivity of the just and judging eye, as profound as it is benevolent, does not itself grow dark, well, that’s a piece of perfection and the highest mastery on earth—even something that it would be wise for people not to expect here; in any event, they should not believe in it too easily. It’s certainly true that, on average, among the most just people themselves even a small dose of hostility, malice, and insinuation is enough to make them see red and chase fairness out of their eyes. The active, aggressive, over-reaching human being is still placed a hundred steps closer to justice than the reactive person. For him it is simply not necessary in the slightest to estimate an object falsely and with bias, the way the reactive man does and must do. Thus, as a matter of fact, at all times the aggressive human being, as the stronger, braver, more noble man, has had on his side a better conscience as well as a more independent eye; by contrast, we can already guess who generally has the invention of “bad conscience” on his conscience—the man of ressentiment! Finally, let’s look around in history: up to now in what area has the whole implementation of law in general as well as the essential need for law been at home on earth? Could it be in the area of the reactive human beings? That is entirely wrong. It is much more the case that it’s been at home with the active, strong, spontaneous, and aggressive men. Historically considered, the law on earth—let me say this to the annoyance of the above-mentioned agitator (who once even confessed about himself “The doctrine of revenge runs through all my work and efforts as the red thread of justice”)—represents that very struggle against the reactive feelings, the war with them on the part of active and aggressive powers, which have partly used up their strength to put a halt to or to restrain the excess of reactive pathos and to compel some settlement with it. Wherever justice is practised, wherever justice is upheld, we see a stronger power in relation to a weaker power standing beneath it (whether with groups or individuals), seeking ways to bring an end among the latter to the senseless rage of ressentiment, partly by dragging the object of ressentiment out of the hands of revenge, partly by setting in the place of revenge a battle against the enemies of peace and order, partly by coming up with compensation, proposing it, under certain circumstances making it compulsory, partly by establishing certain equivalents for injuries as a norm, into which from now on ressentiment is directed once and for all. The most decisive factor, however, which the highest power carries out and sets in place against the superior numbers of the feelings of hostility and animosity—something that power always does as soon as it is somehow strong enough to do it—is to set up law, the imperative explanation of those things which, in its own eyes, are generally considered allowed and legal and things which are considered forbidden and illegal, while after the establishment of the law, the authorities treat attacks and arbitrary acts of individuals or entire groups as an outrage against the law, as rebellion against the highest power itself, and they steer the feeling of those beneath them away from the immediate damage caused by such outrages and thus, in the long run, achieve the reverse of what all revenge desires, which sees only the viewpoint of the injured party and considers only that valid. From now on, the eye becomes trained to evaluate actions always impersonally, even the eye of the harmed party itself (although this would be the very last thing to occur, as I have remarked earlier).—Consequently, only with the setting up of the law is there a “just” and “unjust” (and not, as Dühring will have it, from the time of the injurious action). To talk of just and unjust in themselves has no sense whatsoever; it’s obvious that in themselves harming, oppressing, exploiting, destroying cannot be “unjust,” inasmuch as life essentially works that way, that is, in its basic functions it harms, oppresses, exploits, and destroys, and cannot be conceived at all without this character. We have to acknowledge something even more disturbing: the fact that from the highest biological standpoint, conditions of justice must always be only exceptional conditions, partial restrictions on the basic will to live, which is set on power; they are subordinate to the total purpose of this will as individual means, that is, as means to create larger units of power. A legal system conceived of as sovereign and universal, not as a means in the struggle of power complexes, but as a means against all struggles in general, something along the lines of Dühring’s communist cliché in which each will must be considered as equal to every will, that would be a principle hostile to life, a destroyer and dissolver of human beings, an assassination attempt on the future of human beings, a sign of exhaustion, a secret path to nothingness.—

Here one more word concerning the origin and purpose of punishment—two problems which are separate or should be separate. Unfortunately people normally throw them together into one. How do the previous genealogists of morality deal with this issue? Naively—the way they have always worked. They find some “purpose” or other for punishment, for example, revenge or deterrence, then in a simple way set this purpose at the beginning as the causa fiendi  of punishment and—they’re finished. The “purpose in law,” however, is the very last idea we should use in the history of the emergence of law. It is much rather the case that for all forms of history there is no more important principle than that one which we reach with such difficulty but which we also really should reach—namely that what causes a particular thing to arise and the final utility of that thing, its actual use and arrangement in a system of purposes, are separate toto coelo  from each other, that something existing, which has somehow come to its present state, will again and again be interpreted by the higher power over it from a new perspective, appropriated in a new way, reorganized for and redirected to new uses, that all events in the organic world involve overpowering, acquiring mastery and that, in turn, all overpowering and acquiring mastery involve a new interpretation, a readjustment, in which the “sense” and “purpose” up to then must necessarily be obscured or entirely erased. No matter how well we have understood the usefulness of some physiological organ or other (or a legal institution, a social custom, a political practice, some style in the arts or in a religious cult), we have still not, in that process, grasped anything about its origin—no matter how uncomfortable and unpleasant this may sound in elderly ears. From time immemorial people have believed that in demonstrable purposes, in the usefulness of a thing, a form, or an institution, they could also understand the reason it came into existence—the eye as something made to see, the hand as something made to grasp. So people also imagined punishment as invented to punish. But all purposes, all uses, are only signs that a will to power has become master over something with less power and has stamped on it its own meaning of some function, and the entire history of a “thing,” an organ, a practice can by this process be seen as a continuing chain of signs of constantly new interpretations and adjustments, whose causes do not even need to be connected to each other—in some circumstances they rather follow and take over from each other by chance. Consequently, the “development” of a thing, a practice, or an organ has nothing to do with its progressus  towards a single goal, even less is it the logical and shortest progressus reached with the least expenditure of power and resources—but rather the sequence of more or less profound, more or less mutually independent processes of overpowering which take place on that thing, together with the resistance which arises against that overpowering each time, the changes of form which have been attempted for the purpose of defence and reaction, as well as the results of successful counter-measures. Form is fluid; the “meaning,” however, is even more so. . . . Even within each individual organism things are no different: with every essential growth in the totality, the “meaning” of the individual organ also shifts—in certain circumstances its partial destruction, a reduction of its numbers (for example, through the obliteration of intermediate structures) can be a sign of growing power and perfection. What I wanted to say is this: the partial loss of utility, decline, and degeneration, the loss of meaning, and purposiveness, in short, death, also belong to the conditions of a real progressus , which always appears in the form of a will and a way to a greater power and always establishes itself at the expense of a huge number of smaller powers. The size of a “step forward” can even be estimated by a measure of everything that had to be sacrificed to it. The humanity as mass sacrificed for the benefit of a single stronger species of man— that would be a step forward . . . . I emphasize this major point of view about historical methodology all the more since it basically runs counter to the very instinct which presently rules and to contemporary taste, which would rather still go along with the absolute contingency, even the mechanical meaninglessness, of all events rather than with the theory of a will to power playing itself out in everything that happens.  The democratic idiosyncrasy of being hostile to everything which rules and wants to rule, the modern hatred of rulers  (to make up a bad word for a bad thing) has gradually transformed itself into and dressed itself up as something spiritual, of the highest spirituality, to such an extent that nowadays step by step it is already infiltrating the strictest, apparently most objective scientific research, and is allowed to infiltrate it. Indeed, it seems to me already to have attained mastery over all of physiology and the understanding of life, to their detriment, as is obvious, because it has conjured away from them their fundamental concept, that of real activity. By contrast, under the pressure of this idiosyncrasy we push “adaptation” into the foreground, that is, a second-order activity, a mere reactivity; in fact, people have defined life itself as an always purposeful inner adaptation to external circumstances (Herbert Spencer). But that simply misjudges the essence of life, its will to power. That overlooks the first priority of the spontaneous, aggressive, over-reaching, re-interpreting, re-directing, and shaping powers, after whose effects the “adaptation” then follows. Thus, the governing role of the highest functions in an organism itself, the ones in which the will for living appear active and creative, are denied. People should remember the criticism Huxley directed at Spencer for his “administrative nihilism.” But the issue here concerns much more than “administration.” . . .*

Returning to the business at hand, that is, to punishment, we have to differentiate between two aspects of it: first its relative duration, the way it is carried out, the action, the “drama,” a certain strict sequence of procedures and, on the other hand, its fluidity, the meaning, the purpose, the expectation linked to the implementation of such procedures. In this matter, we can here assume, without further comment, per analogium , in accordance with the major viewpoints about the historical method we have just established, that the procedure itself will be somewhat older and earlier than its use as a punishment, that the latter was only first injected and interpreted into the procedure (which had been present for a long time but was a custom with a different meaning), in short, that it was not what our naive genealogists of morality and law up to now have assumed, who collectively imagined that the procedure was invented for the purpose of punishment, just as people earlier thought that the hand was invented for the purpose of grasping. Now, so far as that other element in punishment is concerned, the fluid element, its “meaning,” in a very late cultural state (for example in contemporary Europe) the idea of “punishment” actually presents not simply one meaning but a whole synthesis of “meanings.” The history of punishment up to now, in general, the history of its use for different purposes, finally crystallizes into a sort of unity, which is difficult to untangle, difficult to analyze, and, it must be stressed, totally incapable of definition. (Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really punish; all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude definition. Only something which has no history is capable of being defined). At an earlier stage, by contrast, that synthesis of “meanings” still appears easier to untangle, as well as even easier to adjust. We can still see how in every individual case the elements in the synthesis alter their valence and rearrange themselves accordingly, so that soon this or that element steps forward and dominates at the expense of the rest; indeed, under certain circumstances one element (say, the purpose of deterrence) appears to rise above all the other elements. In order to give at least an idea of how uncertain, how belated, how accidental “the meaning” of punishment is and how one and the same procedure can be used, interpreted, or adjusted for fundamentally different purposes, let me offer here an example which presented itself to me on the basis of relatively little random material: punishment as a way of rendering someone harmless, as a prevention from further harm; punishment as compensation for the damage to the person injured, in some form or other (also in the form of emotional compensation); punishment as isolation of some upset to an even balance in order to avert a wider outbreak of the disturbance; punishment as way of inspiring fear of those who determine and carry out punishment; punishment as a sort of compensation for the advantages which the law breaker has enjoyed up until that time (for example, when he is made useful as a slave working in the mines); punishment as a cutting out of a degenerate element (in some circumstances an entire branch, as in Chinese law, and thus a means to keep the race pure or to sustain a social type); punishment as festival, that is, as the violation and humiliation of some enemy one has finally thrown down; punishment as a way of making a conscience, whether for the man who suffers the punishment— so- called “reform”—or whether for those who witness the punishment being carried out; punishment as the payment of an honorarium, set as a condition by those in power, which protects the wrong doer from the excesses of revenge; punishment as a compromise with the natural condition of revenge, insofar as the latter is still upheld and assumed as a privilege by powerful families; punishment as a declaration of war and a war measure against an enemy to peace, law, order, and authority, which people fight with the very measures war makes available, as something dangerous to the community, as a breach of contract with respect to its conditions, as a rebel, traitor, and breaker of the peace.
14
Of course, this list is not complete. Obviously punishment is overloaded with all sorts of useful purposes, all the more reason why people can infer from it an alleged utility, which, in the popular consciousness at least, is considered its most essential one—faith in punishment, which nowadays for several reasons is getting shaky, still finds its most powerful support in precisely that. Punishment is supposed to be valuable in waking the feeling of guilt in the guilty party. In punishment people are looking for the actual instrument for that psychic reaction called “bad conscience,” “pangs of conscience.” But in doing this, people are misappropriating reality and psychology, even for today, and how much more for the longest history of man, his prehistory! Real pangs of conscience are something extremely rare, especially among criminals and prisoners. Prisons and penitentiaries are not breeding grounds in which this species of gnawing worm particularly likes to thrive:—on that point all conscientious observers agree, in many cases delivering such a judgment with sufficient unwillingness, going against their own desires. In general, punishment makes people hard and cold. It concentrates. It sharpens the feeling of estrangement; it strengthens powers of resistance. If it comes about that punishment shatters a man’s energy and brings on a wretched prostration and self-abasement, such a consequence is surely even less pleasant than the typical result of punishment, characteristically a dry, gloomy seriousness. However, if we consider those thousands of years before the history of humanity, without a second thought we can conclude that the very development of a feeling of guilt was most powerfully hindered by punishment—at least with respect to the victims onto whom this force of punishment was vented. For let us not underestimate just how much the criminal is prevented by the very sight of judicial and executive procedures themselves from sensing that his act, the nature of his action, is something inherently reprehensible, for he sees exactly the same kind of actions committed in the service of justice, then applauded and practised in good conscience, like espionage, lying, bribery, entrapment, the whole tricky and sly art of the police and prosecution, as it manifests itself in the various kinds of punishment—the robbery, oppression, abuse, imprisonment, torture, murder, all done, moreover, as a matter of principle, without even any emotional involvement as an excuse— all these actions are in no way rejected or condemned in themselves by his judges, but only in particular respects when used for certain purposes. “Bad conscience,” this most creepy and most interesting plant among our earthly vegetation, did not grow in this soil—in fact, for the longest period in the past nothing about dealing with a “guilty party” penetrated the consciousness of judges or even those doing the punishing. By contrast, they were dealing with someone who had caused harm, with an irresponsible piece of fate. And even the man on whom punishment later fell, once again like a piece of fate, experienced in that no “inner pain,” other than what might have come from the sudden arrival of something unpredictable, a terrible natural event, a falling, crushing boulder against which there is no way to fight any more.
15
At one point Spinoza became aware of this issue in an incriminating way (something which irritates his interpreters, like Kuno Fischer, who really go to great lengths to misunderstand him on this matter), when one afternoon, he came up against some memory or other (who knows what?) and pondered the question about what, as far as he was concerned, was left of the celebrated morsus conscientiae —for him, the man who had expelled good and evil into human fantasies and had irascibly defended the honour of his “free” God against those blasphemers who claimed that in everything God worked sub ratione boni  (“but that means that God would be subordinate to Fate, a claim which, in truth, would be the greatest of all contradictions”). For Spinoza the world had gone back again into that state of innocence in which it had existed before the invention of bad conscience. So with that what, then, had become of the morsus conscientiae? “The opposite of gaudium ,” Spinoza finally told himself “is sorrow, accompanied by the image of something over and done with which happened contrary to all expectation” (Ethics III, Proposition XVIII, Schol. I. II). In a manner no different from Spinoza’s, those instigating evil who incurred punishment have for thousands of years felt, so far as their “crime” is concerned, “Something has unexpectedly gone awry here,” not “I should not have done that”—they submitted to their punishment as people submit to a sickness or some bad luck or death, with that brave fatalism free of revolt which, for example, even today gives the Russians an advantage over us westerners in coping with life. If back then there was some criticism of the act, such criticism came from prudence: without question we must seek the essential effect of punishment above all in an increase of prudence, in an extension of memory, in a will to go to work from now on more carefully, more mistrustfully, more secretly, with the awareness that we are in many things definitely too weak, in a kind of improved ability to judge ourselves. In general, what can be achieved through punishment, in human beings and animals, is an increase in fear, a honing of prudence, control over desires. In the process, punishment tames human beings, but it does not make them “better”—people could with more justification assert the opposite. (Popular wisdom says “Injury makes people prudent,” but to the extent that it makes them prudent, it also makes them bad. Fortunately, often enough it makes people stupid).
16
At this point, I can no longer avoid setting out, in an initial, provisional statement, my own hypothesis about the origin of “bad conscience.” It is not easy to get people to attend to it, and it requires them to consider it at length, to guard it, and to sleep on it. I consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings had to come down with under the pressure of that most fundamental of all the changes which they ever experienced—that change when they finally found themselves locked within the confines of society and peace. Just like the things water animals must have gone though when they were forced either to become land animals or to die off, so events must have played themselves out with this half-beast so happily adapted to the wilderness, war, wandering around, adventure—suddenly all its instincts were devalued and “disengaged.” From this point on, these animals were to go on foot and “carry themselves”; whereas previously they had been supported by the water. A terrible heaviness weighed them down. In performing the simplest things they felt ungainly. In dealing with this new unknown world, they no longer had their old leaders, the ruling unconscious drives which guided them safely—these unfortunate creatures were reduced to thinking, inferring, calculating, bringing together cause and effect, reduced to their “consciousness,” their most impoverished and error-prone organ! I believe that never on earth has there been such a feeling of misery, such a leaden discomfort—while at the same time those old instincts had not all of a sudden stopped imposing their demands! Only it was difficult and seldom possible to do their bidding. For the most part, they had to find new and, as it were, underground satisfactions for themselves. All instincts which are not discharged to the outside are turned back inside—this is what I call the internalization  of man. From this first grows in man what people later call his “soul.” The entire inner world, originally as thin as if stretched between two layers of skin, expanded and extended itself, acquired depth, width, and height, to the extent that what a person discharged out into the world was obstructed. Those frightening fortifications with which the organization of the state protected itself against the old instincts for freedom—punishments belong above all to these fortifications—brought it about that all those instincts of the wild, free, roaming man turned themselves backwards, against man himself. Enmity, cruelty, joy in pursuit, in attack, in change, in destruction—all those turned themselves against the possessors of such instincts. That is the origin of “bad conscience.” The man who, because of a lack of external enemies and opposition, was forced into an oppressive narrowness and regularity of custom impatiently tore himself apart, persecuted himself, gnawed away at himself, grew upset, and did himself damage—this animal which scraped itself raw against the bars of its cage, which people want to “tame,” this impoverished creature, consumed with longing for the wild, which had to create out of its own self an adventure, a torture chamber, an uncertain and dangerous wilderness—this fool, this yearning and puzzled prisoner, became the inventor of “bad conscience.” But with him was introduced the greatest and weirdest illness, from which humanity up to the present time has not recovered, the suffering of man from man, from himself, a consequence of the forcible separation from his animal past, a leap and, so to speak, a fall into new situations and living conditions, a declaration of war against the old instincts, on which, up to that point, his power, joy, and ability to inspire fear had been based. Let us at once add that, on the other hand, the fact that there was on earth an animal soul turned against itself, taking sides against itself, meant there was something so new, profound, unheard of, enigmatic, contradictory, and full of the future, that with it the picture of the earth was fundamentally changed. In fact, it required divine spectators to appreciate the dramatic performance which then began and whose conclusion is by no means yet in sight—a spectacle too fine, too wonderful, too paradoxical, to be allowed to play itself out senselessly and unobserved on some ridiculous star or other! Since then man has been included among the most unexpected and most thrillingly lucky rolls of the dice in the game played by Heraclitus’ “great child,” whether he’s called Zeus or chance.* For himself he arouses a certain interest, a tension, a hope, almost a certainty, as if something is announcing itself with him, something is preparing itself, as if the human being were not the goal but only a way, an episode, a bridge, a great promise . . .
17
Inherent in this hypothesis about the origin of bad conscience is, firstly, the assumption that the change was not gradual or voluntary and did not manifest itself as an organic growth into new conditions, but as a break, a leap, something forced, an irrefutable disaster, against which there was no struggle nor even any ressentiment. Secondly, however, it assumes that the adaptation of a populace hitherto unchecked and shapeless into a fixed form, just as it was initiated by an act of violence, was carried to its conclusion by nothing but acts of violence—that consequently the oldest “State” emerged as a terrible tyranny, as an oppressive and inconsiderate machinery, and continued working until such raw materials of people and half-animals finally were not only thoroughly kneaded and submissive but also given a shape. I used the word “State”: it is self-evident who is meant by that term—some pack of blond predatory animals, a race of conquerors and masters, which, organized for war and with the power to organize, without thinking about it, sets its terrifying paws on a subordinate population which may perhaps be vast in numbers but is still without any form, is still wandering about. That is, in fact, the way the “State” begins on earth. I believe that fantasy has been done away with which sees the beginning of the state in a “contract.” The man who can command, who is by nature a “master,” who comes forward with violence in his actions and gestures—what has he to do with making contracts! We do not negotiate with such beings. They come like fate, without cause, reason, consideration, or pretext. They are present as lightning is present, too fearsome, too sudden, too convincing, too “different” even to become merely hated. Their work is the instinctive creation of forms, the imposition of forms. They are the most involuntary and most unconscious artists in existence:—where they appear something new is soon present, a power structure which lives, something in which the parts and functions are demarcated and coordinated, in which there is, in general, no place for anything which does not first derive its “meaning” from its relationship to the totality. These men, these born organizers, have no idea what guilt, responsibility, and consideration are. In them that fearsome egotism of the artist is in charge, which stares out like bronze and knows how to justify itself for all time in the “work,” just as a mother does in her child. They are not the ones in whom “bad conscience” grew—that point is obvious from the outset. But this hateful plant would not have grown without them. It would have failed if an immense amount of freedom had not been driven from the world under the pressure of their hammer blows, their artistic violence, or at least had not been driven from sight and, as it were, made latent. This powerful instinct for freedom, once made latent—we already understand how—this instinct for freedom driven back, repressed, imprisoned inside, and finally still able to discharge and direct itself only against itself—that and that alone is what bad conscience is in its beginning.
18
We need to be careful not to entertain a low opinion of this entire phenomenon simply because it is from the start nasty and painful. In fact, it is basically the same active force which is at work on a grander scale in those artists of power and organizers and which builds states. Here it is inner, smaller, more mean spirited, directing itself backwards, into “the labyrinth of the breast,” to use Goethe’s words, and it creates bad conscience for itself and builds negative ideals, just that instinct for freedom (to use my own language, the will to power). Only the material on which the shaping and violating nature of this force directs itself here is simply man himself, his entire old animal self— and not, as in that greater and more striking phenomenon, on another man or on other men. This furtive violation of the self, this artistic cruelty, this pleasure in giving a shape to oneself as a tough, resisting, suffering material, to burn into it a will, a critique, a contradiction, a contempt, a denial, this weird and horribly pleasurable work of a soul willingly divided against itself, which makes itself suffer for the pleasure of creating suffering, all this active “bad conscience,” as the essential womb of ideal and imaginative events, finally brought to light —we have already guessed—also an abundance of strange new beauty and affirmation and perhaps for the first time the idea of the beautiful in general. . . . For what would be “beautiful,” if its opposite had not yet come to an awareness of itself, if ugliness had not already said to itself, “I am ugly”? At least, after this hint the paradox will be less puzzling, the extent to which in contradictory ideas, like selflessness, self-denial, self-sacrifice, an ideal can be indicated, something beautiful. And beyond that, one thing we do know—I have no doubt about it—namely, the nature of the pleasure which the selfless, self-denying, self-sacrificing person experiences from the beginning: this pleasure belongs to cruelty. So much for the moment on the origin of the “un-egoistic” as something of moral worth and on the demarcation of the soil out of which this value has grown: only bad conscience, only the will to abuse the self, provides the condition for the value of the un-egoistic.
19
Bad conscience is a sickness—there’s no doubt about that—but a sickness the way pregnancy is a sickness. Let’s look for the conditions in which this illness has arrived at its most terrible and most sublime peak:—in this way we’ll see what really brought about its entry into the world at the start. But that requires a lot of endurance—and we must first go back once more to an earlier point of view. The relationship in civil law between the debtor and his creditor, which I have reviewed extensively already, has been interpreted once again in an extremely remarkable and dubious historical manner into a relationship which we modern men are perhaps least capable of understanding, namely, into the relationship between those people presently alive and their ancestors. Within the original tribal cooperatives—we’re talking about primeval times—the living generation always acknowledged a legal obligation to the previous generations, and especially to the earliest one which had founded the tribe (and this was in no way merely a sentimental obligation: the latter is something we could even reasonably claim was, in general, absent for the longest period of the human race). Here the reigning conviction is that the tribe exists at all only because of the sacrifices and achievements of its ancestors—and that people have to pay them back with sacrifices and achievements.  In this people recognize a debt which keeps steadily growing because these ancestors in their continuing existence as powerful spirits do not stop giving the tribe new advantages and lending them their power. Do they do this gratuitously? But there is no “gratuitously” for those raw and “spiritually destitute” ages. What can people give back to them? Sacrifices (at first as nourishment understood very crudely), festivals, chapels, signs of honour, above all, obedience—for all customs, as work of one’s ancestors, are also their statutes and commands. Do people ever give them enough? This suspicion remains and grows. From time to time it forcefully requires a huge wholesale redemption, something immense as a repayment  to the “creditor” (the notorious sacrifice of the first born, for example, blood, human blood in any case). The fear of ancestors and their power, the awareness of one’s debt to them, according to this kind of logic, necessarily increases directly in proportion to the increase in the power of the tribe itself, as the tribe finds itself constantly more victorious, more independent, more honoured, and more feared. It’s not the other way around! Every step towards the decline of the tribe, all conditions of misery, all indications of degeneration, of approaching dissolution, rather lead to a constant lessening of the fear of the spirit of its founder and give a constantly smaller image of his wisdom, providence, and powerful presence. If we think this crude form of logic through to its conclusion, then the ancestors of the most powerful tribes must, because of the fantasy of increasing fear, finally have grown into something immense and have been pushed back into the darkness of a divine mystery, something beyond the powers of imagination, so that finally the ancestor is necessarily transfigured into a god. Here perhaps lies even the origin of the gods, thus an origin out of fear! . . . And the man to whom it seems obligatory to add “But also out of piety” could hardly claim to be right for the longest period of the human race, for his primaeval age. Of course, he would be all the more correct for the middle period, in which the noble tribes developed—those who in fact paid back to their founders, their ancestors (heroes, gods), with interest, all the characteristics which in the meantime had become manifest in themselves, the noble qualities. Later we will have another look at the process by which the gods were ennobled and exalted (which is naturally not at all the same thing as their becoming “holy”). But now, for the moment, let’s follow the path of this whole development of the consciousness of guilt to its conclusion.
20
As history teaches us, the consciousness of being in debt to the gods did not in any way come to an end after the downfall of the organization of the “community” based on blood relationships. Just as humanity inherited the ideas of “good and bad” from the nobility of the tribe (together with its fundamental psychological tendency to set up orders of rank), in the same way people also inherited, as well as the divinities of the tribe and of the extended family, the pressure of as yet unpaid debts and the desire to be relieved of them. (The transition is made with those numerous slave and indentured populations which adapted themselves to the divine cults of their masters, whether through compulsion or through obsequiousness and mimicry; from them this inheritance then overflowed in all directions). The feeling of being indebted to the gods did not stop growing for several thousands of years, always, in fact, in direct proportion to the extent to which the idea of god and the feeling for god grew on earth and were carried to the heights. (The entire history of ethnic fighting, victory, reconciliation, mergers, everything which comes before the final rank ordering of all the elements of a people in every great racial synthesis, is mirrored in the tangled genealogies of its gods, in the sagas of their fights, victories, and reconciliations. The progress towards universal empires is always also the progress toward universal divinities. In addition, despotism, with its overthrow of the independent nobility always builds the way to some variety of monotheism). The arrival of the Christian god, as the greatest  god which has yet been reached, thus brought about the maximum feeling of indebtedness on earth. Assuming that we have gradually set out in the reverse direction, we can infer with no small probability that, given the inexorable decline of faith in the Christian god, even now there may already be a considerable decline in the human consciousness of guilt. Indeed, we cannot dismiss the idea that the complete and final victory of atheism could release humanity from this entire feeling of being indebted to its origin, its causa prima . Atheism and a kind of second innocence belong together.—
21
So much for a brief and rough preface concerning the connection between the ideas “guilt” and “obligation” with religious assumptions. Up to this point I have deliberately set aside the actual moralizing of these ideas (the repression of them into the conscience, or more precisely, the complex interaction of the bad conscience with the idea of god). At the end of the previous section I even talked as if there were no such thing as this moralizing and thus as if those ideas were now necessarily coming to an end after the collapse of their presuppositions, the faith in our “creditor,” in God. But to a terrifying extent the facts indicate something different. The moralizing of the ideas of debt and duty, with their repression into the bad conscience, actually gave rise to the attempt to reverse the direction of the development I have just described, or at least to bring its motion to a halt. Now, in a fit of pessimism, the prospect of a final installment must once and for all be denied; now, our gaze must bounce and ricochet back despairingly off an iron impossibility, now those ideas of “debt” and “duty” must  turn back. But against whom? There can be no doubt: first of all against the “debtor,” in whom from this point on bad conscience sets itself firmly, gnaws away, spreads out, and, like a polyp, grows wide and deep to such an extent that finally, with the impossibility of discharging the debt, people also come up with the notion that it is impossible to remove the penance, the idea that it cannot be paid off (“eternal punishment”):—finally however, those ideas of “debt” and “duty” turn back even against the “creditor.” People should, in this matter, now think about the causa prima  of humanity, about the beginning of the human race, about their ancestor who from now on is loaded down with a curse (“Adam,” “original sin,” “no freedom of the will”) or about nature from whose womb human beings arose and into which the principle of evil is now inserted (“the demonizing of nature”) or about existence in general, which remains something inherently without value  (nihilistic turning away from existence, longing for nothingness, or a desire for its “opposite,” in an alternate state of being, Buddhism and things like that)—until all of a sudden we confront the paradoxical and horrifying expedient with which a martyred humanity found temporary relief, that stroke of genius of Christianity: God sacrificing himself for the guilt of human beings, God paying himself back with himself, God as the only one who can redeem man from what for human beings has become impossible to redeem—the creditor sacrificing himself for the debtor, out of love (can people believe that?), out of love for his debtor! . . .

You will already have guessed what really went on with all this and under all this: that will to self-torment, that repressed cruelty of animal man pushed inward and forced back into himself, imprisoned in the “state” to make him tame, who invented bad conscience in order to lacerate himself, after the more natural discharge of this will to inflict pain had been blocked—this man of bad conscience seized upon religious assumptions to drive his self-torment to its most horrifying hardship and ferocity. Guilt towards God: this idea becomes his instrument of torture. In “God” he seizes on the ultimate contrast he is capable of discovering to his real and indissoluble animal instincts. He interprets these animal instincts themselves as a crime against God (as enmity, rebellion, revolt against the “master,” the “father,” the original ancestor and beginning of the world). He grows tense with the contradiction of “God” and “devil.” He hurls from himself every “No” which he says to himself, to nature, naturalness, the factual reality  of his being as a “Yes,” as something existing, as living, as real, as God, as the blessedness of God, as God the Judge, as God the Hangman, as something beyond him, as eternity, as perpetual torment, as hell, as punishment and guilt beyond measure. In this spiritual cruelty there is a kind of insanity of the will which simply has no equal: a man’s will finding him so guilty and reprehensible that there is no atonement, his will to imagine himself punished, but in such a way that the punishment could never be adequate for his crime, his will to infect and poison the most fundamental basis of things with the problem of punishment and guilt in order to cut himself off once and for all from any exit out of this labyrinth of “fixed ideas,” his will to erect an ideal—that of the “holy God”—in order to be tangibly certain of his own absolute worthlessness when confronted with it. O this insane, sad beast man! What ideas it has, what unnaturalness, what paroxysms of nonsense, what bestiality of thought breaks from it as soon as it is prevented, if only a little, from being a beast in deed! . . . All this is excessively interesting, but there’s also a black, gloomy, unnerving sadness about it, so that man must forcefully hold himself back from gazing too long into these abysses. Here we have illness  — no doubt about that—the most terrifying illness that has raged in human beings up to now:—and anyone who can still hear (but nowadays people no longer have the ear for that!—) how in this night of torment and insanity the cry of love has resounded, the cry of the most yearning delight, of redemption through love, turns away, seized by an invincible horror. . . In human beings there is so much that is terrible! . . . The world has already been a lunatic asylum for too long!
23
These remarks should be sufficient, once and for all, concerning the origin of the “holy God.”—The fact that conceiving gods does not necessarily, in itself, have to lead to this degraded imagination, that’s something we could not excuse ourselves from recalling for a moment, the point that there are more uplifting ways to use the invention of the gods than for this human self-crucifixion and self-laceration, in which Europe in the last millennia has become an expert—fortunately that’s something we can still infer with every glance we cast at the Greek gods, these reflections of nobler men, more rulers of themselves, in whom the animal in man felt himself deified and did not tear himself apart, did not rage against himself! These Greeks for the longest time used their gods for the very purpose of keeping that “bad conscience” at a distance, in order to be permitted to continue enjoying their psychic freedom. Hence, their understanding was the opposite of how Christianity used its God. In this matter the Greeks went a very long way, these splendid and lion-hearted Greeks, with their child-like minds. And no lesser authority than that of Homer’s Zeus himself now and then lets them understand that they are making things too easy for themselves. “It’s strange,” he says at one point in relation to the case of Aegisthus, a very bad case—
It’s strange how these mortal creatures complain about the gods!
Evil comes only from us, they claim, but they themselves
Stupidly make themselves miserable, even contrary to fate.*
But at the same time we hear and see that even this Olympian spectator and judge is far from being irritated and from thinking them evil because of this: “How foolish they are,” he thinks in relation to the bad deeds of mortal men—and even the Greeks of the strongest and bravest times conceded that much about themselves—the “foolishness,” “stupidity,” a little “disturbance in the head” were the basis for many bad and fateful things—foolishness, not sin! Do you understand that? . . . But even this disturbance in the head was a problem, “Indeed, how is this even possible? Where could this have really come from in heads like the ones we have, we men of noble descent, happy, successful, from the best society, noble, and virtuous?”—for hundreds of years the aristocratic Greek posed this question to himself in relation to every horror or outrage incomprehensible to him which had defiled one of his peers. “Some god must have deluded him,” he finally said, shaking his head . . . This solution is typical of the Greeks . . . In this way, the gods then served to justify men to a certain extent, even in bad things. They served as the origins of evil—at that time the gods took upon themselves, not punishment, but, what is nobler, the guilt. . .
24
—I’ll conclude with three question marks—that’s clear enough. You may perhaps ask me, “Is an ideal actually being built up here or shattered?” . . . But have you ever really asked yourself enough how high a price has been paid on earth for the construction of every ideal? How much reality had to be constantly vilified and misunderstood for that to happen, how many lies had to be consecrated, how many consciences corrupted, how much “god” had to be sacrificed every time? In order to enable a shrine to be built, a shrine must be destroyed: that is the law—show me the case where it has not been fulfilled! We modern men, we are the inheritors of thousands of years of vivisection of the conscience and self-inflicted animal torture. That’s what we have had the longest practice doing, that is perhaps our artistry; in any case, it’s something we have refined, the corruption of our taste. For too long man has looked at his natural inclinations with an “evil eye,” so that finally in him they have become twinned with “bad conscience.” An attempt to reverse this might, in itself, be possible—but who is strong enough for it, that is, to link as siblings bad conscience and the unnatural inclinations, all those aspirations for what lies beyond, those things which go against our senses, against our instincts, against nature, against animals—in short, the earlier ideals, all the ideals which are hostile to life, ideals of those who vilify the world? To whom can we turn to today with such hopes and demands? . . .  In this we would have precisely the good people against us, as well, of course, as the comfortable, the complacent, the vain, the enthusiastic, the tired. . . .  But what is more deeply offensive, what cuts us off so fundamentally, as letting them take some note of the severity and loftiness with which  we deal with ourselves? And, by contrast, how obliging, how friendly all the world is in relation to us, as soon as we act as all the world does and “let ourselves go” just like all the world! To attain the goal I’m talking about requires a different sort of spirit from those which are likely to exist at this particular time: spirits empowered by war and victory, for whom conquest, adventure, danger, and even pain have become a need. That would require getting acclimatized to keen, high air, winter wanderings, to ice and mountains in every sense. That would require even a kind of sublime maliciousness, an ultimate self-conscious wilfulness of knowledge, which comes with great health. Simply and seriously put, that would require just this great health! . . . Is this even possible today? . . . But at some time or other, in a more powerful time than this mouldy, self-doubting present, he must nonetheless come to us, the redeeming man of great love and contempt, the creative spirit, constantly pushed again and again away from every sideline or from the beyond by his own driving power, whose isolation is misunderstood by people as if it were a flight from reality—whereas it is only his immersion, burial, and absorption in reality, so that once he comes out of it into the light again, he brings home the redemption of this reality, its redemption from the curse which the previous ideal has laid upon it. This man of the future, who will release us from that earlier ideal just as much as from what had to grow from it, from the great loathing, from the will to nothingness, from nihilism—that stroke of noon and of the great decision which makes the will free once again, who gives back to the earth its purpose and to the human being his hope, this anti-Christ and anti-nihilist, this conqueror of God and of nothingness—at some point he must come . . .
25
But what am I talking about here? Enough, enough! At this stage there’s only one thing appropriate for me to do: keep quiet. Otherwise, I’ll make the mistake of arrogating to myself something which only someone younger is free to do, someone “more of the future,” someone more powerful than I am—something which only Zarathustra is free to do, Zarathustra the Godless . . . .*

Nietzsche quotes the Latin: “si plus minusve secuerunt, ne fraude esto.” 
Spinoza: Baruch de Spinoza (1632-1677), important Dutch rationalist philosopher. 
Pope Innocent III: (1161-1216), an important and powerful medieval Pope. 
. . . ressentiment: As mentioned above (in the First Essay), Nietzsche uses this French word, which since his writing, and largely because of it, has entered the English language as an important term in psychology: a short definition is as follows: “deep-seated resentment, frustration, and hostility, accompanied by a sense of being powerless to express these feelings directly” (Merriam-Webster). Ressentiment is thus significantly different in meaning from resentment. 
E. Dühring: (1833-1921), German philosopher and economist.  
Herbert Spencer: (1820-1903), English philosopher who advanced the idea of evolution as a progressive process in society. Huxley: Thomas Huxley (1825-1895): a major English champion of Darwin’s evolutionary ideas. 
Heraclitus: (c. 535-475 BC) an important pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. 
Zeus makes these remarks to the other Olympian gods at the start of Homer’s Odyssey. Aegisthus seduced Clytaemnestra, and the two of them murdered Agamemnon, her husband, as soon as he returned home from the Trojan War. The gods, according to Homer, had warned him against these actions. 
Zarathustra: a name for the Persian prophet Zoroaster, which Nietzsche appropriates to designate a spokesman for his own ideas. "

southern nights,glen campbell,1977,1970,"Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting

satisfy you,puff daddy ,1999,1990,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true


Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

sailing,christopher cross,1980,1980,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me

No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free


Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away

You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
(Still the same, still the same)
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
(Still the same, still the same)
You're still the same
You still aim high
There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say

'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some things never change
You're still the same"

a whiter shade of pale,procol harum,1967,1960,"We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale"

stay (i missed you) ,lisa loeb ,1994,1990,"You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time.  So?
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
And you say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
Or to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no (bad)
And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song:
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well.  Well, this is not that:
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown
And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you
You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, ""hey, I can leave, I can leave.""
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said you caught me ‘cause you want me
And one day you’d let me go
You try to give away a keeper, but keep me cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, ""Stay.""
And you say I only hear what I want to"

ain't no way to treat a lady,helen reddy,1975,1970,"I guess it was yourself you were involved with
I would have sworn it was me
I might have found out sooner
If you'd only let me close enough to see
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
I was only being a picture
With all the colors I know
While you were busy looking
Into wide blue mirrors and loving the show
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
There's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane
And I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain
You see the time you never felt me loving you or needing you
So leaving you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain
I was looking out for my happiness
While you were looking within
And before you know your own reflection
Always starts to tire you and it's happened again
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end"

When the heat of a rolling wave
Can be turned away

And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)

slow hand,the pointer sisters,1981,1980,"As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooh, we got the time
'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I've got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
I found a lover with a slow hand
Ooh, a lover with a slow hand

And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush
Ooh, lover with a slow hand"

And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

an everlasting love,andy gibb,1978,1970,"I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold
Give me what I've hungered for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show
And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears

smoke on the water,deep purple,1973,1970,"We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile We didn t have much time Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound Uh, Funky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids on the ground When it all was over We had to find another place But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty, cold, and bare But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside Making our music there With a few red lights, a few old beds We make a place to sweat No matter what we get out of this Ha, I know, I know we ll never forget Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water"
rock and roll music,the beach boys,1976,1970,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony


I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane


Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Outro
Say, if you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that
If you wanna dance with me"
america,neil diamond,1981,1980,"Far
We've been traveling far
Without a home
But not without a star
Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream
On the boats and on the planes
They're coming to America
Never looking back again
They're coming to America
Home, don't it seem so far away
Oh, we're traveling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and we'll say our grace
Freedom's light burning warm
Freedom's light burning warm
Everywhere around the world
They're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled
They're coming to America
Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America

My country 'tis of thee
Today
Sweet land of liberty
Today
Of thee I sing
Today
Of thee I sing

only one you,t.g. sheppard,1982,1980,"I've seen this world
From corner to corner
There ain't much ground
That I haven't covered
I've drank its wine
I've tasted its pleasures
I've known some love
And I've known some lovers
If there's one lesson
In the livin' I've done
The best things only come
Along in numbers of one
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
I've been a king
And I've been a pauper
And everything there is in between
It took some time
To know what is timeless
But I've found and
Learned what that means
I'll never leave you, girl
'Cause I know the catch
The wonders of this world
Will never come with a match
There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue
There's only one Mona Lisa

picture postcards from l.a.,joshua kadison,1994,1990,"I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A
When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
And I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say
I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, ""Next week, I'm gonna go.""
She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay
And still no picture postcards from L.A
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door

Whitney, what's this about?

Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me

I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe

Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me



It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure"

For a second straight record for them fools disrespectin

MTV, the Box, BET it's still hits
24-7 eastsidein' it, G ridin
We slidin, bomb to the fullest, fuck hidin' it
You know what's up wit' me the dollar bill and my steal
I play for keeps, that's on the real
Now get the glass and the yak and take a step back
And try to figure out this nigga Wayniac, the maniac

It's like this, or should I say it's like that (like that)
I got that knack to make the beats smack
From my nine-millimeter microphone Mack

We just doin' our thang, straight up, it's fixin' to hit the fan
Serious like that cuz some ain't goin understand
Anticipation got'em all on the sack
All my time that I gotta spin up that track
Money got me motivated, word up to my moms
Nine-four set it up so now it's time for the bomb
To get dropped, non-stop on my way to the T-O-P
Servin' conversation, as if it were some cavi

You could tell I was a hustla from the start
Which meant the Locc and me could never ever see a mark
Cuz sippin-ass niggas wear them pumps to get fed
Bitches steady gankin' while they puffin' up your head
Since I'm the Loc they come and show we just chillin
Peepin out my whole click I'm wit make a killin
You know me I'm the one that will always make'em pay
But for now I'ma slide and listen to the women as they say

Catch a grip young Tripp, that's what they told me
I gotta thank god for all my true homies
You molded me, into a true G
That's how I put it down (That's right) with Tripnology
And dissocology from G to G
Helps a nigga like me see clearly
I'm tellin' you the truth with proof
It's like a pimp tryin to pimp some hoes with no coupe

I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be, I will I will
Cuz I saw you walking down the hall
And I had a lot to tell you but I didn't think you could say it better, oh baby
You're good at making me feel so small
And I know you made your point but I just don't want to remember, yeah
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
With your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination
So come on let me sing
I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be, I will I will
Cause I'm dancing around in your world of play

talk show shhh!,shae jones,1999,1990,"Who da hell you think you messin' wit
Tryin' to play me like a fool
I overheard a conversation
Between your ex-girlfriend and you
Then I saw it so clearly
Suddenly it all made since
Before you go on explaining yourself
Let me explain my evidence

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I felt like you was hiding something
When you started showering alone
And someone used my Chanel perfume
Since this moment when I left home
You tiptoeing in the bedroom
While your thinking i'm asleep
If I catch your ass in one more lie
I'll be telling you to leave
No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

He say, she say
You got our business all up in the streets cheatin'
He say, she say
Everyone knows us like we're on t.v

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back

arc of a diver,steve winwood,1981,1980,"She bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman
This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger

one of these days,tim mcgraw,1998,1990,"We used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love me"

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick, named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers to spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me, dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
And I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind

Ay yo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never the ladiez hypnotize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bouswar
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

Man on the TV's gone insane, everybody's just laughing

My neighbor lost his house cause he can't find a job
Don't you dare pledge allegiance, don't you dare speak of God
Speak of God
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Now I'm begging for forgiveness
I wanna make a difference even in the smallest way
I'm only one person, but I can feel it working
I believe in better days
That's why I pray
Some stupid video posted as a joke, somebody's life gets ruined
Out of everything we can create
Where is the cure to keep the sick from losing
Babies having babies cause their parents are always gone
Somehow we have forgotten how to make a house a home
How to make a house a home
Oh! Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm begging for forgiveness, I wanna make a difference
Even in the smallest way
I'm only one person, but I can feel it working
I believe in better days
That's why I pray, yeah
That's why I pray, yeah
These demons from my past haunt me every night
And I just can't get through it
If I could forget them on my own, I'll let go and just move on
But heaven knows I am only human
And that's why I pray, yeah yeah
That's why I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
Yes I'm begging for forgiveness
I just wanna make a difference
I believe in better days
That's why I pray"

someone to love me for me,lisa lisa,1988,1980,"Oh

End of another long show
And I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave
Because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screamed out
""No, just let dreams be your master""
Look past my fame. I'm in need
Need of some laughter

Oh, please let me live in your world
I hope that your eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me
Mmm
Me

So you ask yourself
Oh, this feeling
Is it true from the heart?
Was it my fame and glory?
Why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
And if I want satisfaction
I can have anyone that I see
But why should I settle for less
When I need you
To love me for me
Oh, so confused
Is this real?
Do you love me?
Give me the feeling you care endlessly
My love

Please let me live in your world
(Oh)
I hope that your eyes can see
(Hope that your eyes can see)
That I need someone

Please let me live in your world
Hey, Paul Anthony
Why don't you say something to all the lovers out there?
Well, Bow-Legged Lou
I was just about to ask you to drop the same science
Well, I got a better idea
Hey, Lisa
Why don't you tell it like you feel it?
Well, I would like to say
To all the lovers of the world
If you are in love with someone
I mean really in love with someone
Make sure that you hold on to that person
Make sure that person
Loves you for who you are
And not for the materialistic things that surround you
Enough said
For me
That I need someone
(Yeah, yeah)
To love me for me"

Every window in my hometown is empty
And I really don't know why

And Lord those gray skies bring me down

To find myself in this quiet town (yeah)
And I'm thinking. .

she don't love you,eric paslay,2015,2010,"She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rolled away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way, oh
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rolled away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only

a good day to run,darryl worley,2001,2000,"I'm tired of working every day for a dollar
About to choke on my own blue collar
This ain't gonna last
Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion
I can't make a move too fast
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run
My baby's been working as a cashier
She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song
There're some places that we ain't been
Some things we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run"

Billys at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!
She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!
Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on
Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Cause life looks good, good, good
So good, good, good
Life looks good, good, good

cherokee,europe,1988,1980,"They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change
Made them realize, that the promises were lies

The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies

So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair

And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

precious declaration,collective soul,1997,1990,"Hitched a ride to the peaceful side of town
Then proceeded where thieves were no longer found
Can't crash now I've been waiting for this
Won't crash now I found some encouragement
Precious declaration reads
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
New meanings to the words I feed upon
Wake within my veins elements of freedom
Can't break now I've been living for this
Won't break now I'm cleansed with hopefulness
Precious declaration says
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
Once I jumped thru hoops of fire
High and far as you required
I was blind but now I see
Salvation has discovered me"
ooohhhwee,master p ,2002,2000,"To the beat y'all

Weebie! Holla at me (c'mon), I'm at the ball
I got like twelve bottles of bubbly (oh)

I like the way she shake it in the thong - OOOHHHWEE!
The way she make it twurk and grab the wall - OOOHHHWEE!
Oh, baby you know whatchu doin - OOOHHHWEE!
No Limit got the steps bouncin and movin - OOOHHHWEE!

I know a big girl, with a ironed skirt
Give her couple dollars, she'll make it work
I mean holla at me whoadie, you know our crew large
My fantasy's to have sex wit two broads
On a boat or a plane, some exotic cars
From a Bentley to a Lex, girl, bring the toys
On the dance floor, shawty started takin it off
Took her to the V.I.P., started breakin me off
Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists
I told her ""Wait, it don't stop, keep drinkin the Cris'""
I'm a country boy just like the Dukes of Hazzard
See a fine chick, you know I'm gon' grab her
Annie May girl where you at?
This No Limit boy tryin to do that thang
I said ""Rock the boat, don't let it sank""
It's time to go to war, I got the tank

 Say that then

I could work, put ya body, c'mon back it up, back it up
You know Weebie and Master P, we gon' tank it up, tank it up
Turn around to the ground, you know how it goes
Catch the flow, tippie-toe, come and wobble some mo'
Like you know how I do it so don't act surprised
For a fact gotchu dancin 'til you hurtin your thighs
Now won'tcha tune it up and wobble wit it
Act a fool and wobble wit it
Won'tcha make it hustle, ooh baby don't pull a muscle
Gotcha workin on the wall 'til you run outta breath
No Limit like I told ya so y'all give us respect
Now you could shake it like a dog, break my fuckin balls
Do it how ya do it, lemme see ya take it off


Now won'tcha rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on
Rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock, rock on, rock
Now won'tcha turn around and hustle wit it
Back it up and hustle wit it, test around and hustle wit it
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Mary had a big ol' butt, in them tight ass jeans it'd show
And every club that Mary was at them thugs were sure to go
I mean she had bow-legs wit the curves just like a bottle
Project chick but pretty just like a model
When I'm rollin through the hood she on dubs
Don't mind gettin in and shakin her thang in the club
I mean, beat bopper she loved the tote shoppers
Call her head nurse then I'mma be the doctor
A real country mamma cook grits and eggs
And she won't leave the farm except to get paid
Candies on twat cause she love to ball
Find her at the mizzle on the dresser or the mall
Buyin, high heels on some leather boots
Or lookin for them ballers wit the crazy loot, WHAT?!



Where them No Limit boys at? Throw them 'bows

she was,mark chesnutt,2002,2000,"She started her new life ten dollars in debt
That's all it took to get started back then
A trip to the courthouse across the state line
No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind
He was eighteen, she wasn't
But she said she was and never thought twice
Came back home as my daddy's wife
She just shook her head when her momma said
""Are you sure he's the one?"" She was
He took a job and farmed on the side
He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied
Changes were coming to their little world
She said ""What would you like, a boy or a girl?""
He said ""Are you?""
She said she was and never thought twice
'Bout takin the next step in building their lives
Soon there were three and she tried to be
Everything to us And she was
Those precious moments turned into years
In what seemed like the blink of an eye
I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her
""Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?""
She said she was but she thought twice
Holdin' my hand as she let go of life
Daddy always said a woman like her
Would be hard to give up
And she was
She was
If there ever was a picture of love
She was"
only when i lose myself,depeche mode,1998,1990,"It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotised, I feel paralysed
I have found heaven

There's a thousand reasons why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
To keep me hanging on feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied, I belong inside
Your velvet heaven
Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this?
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss?
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
Before I could even start to understand?

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

My coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes
Before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work
Every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been
And in a crowded elevator
I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting
Looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies
And I can't help but laugh
That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those ""kiss me"" green eyes smilin' back at me
That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
An sometimes in the evening
I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the sent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again
That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek

They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while

Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you

Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P

One more evening gone to waste
No longer do I know my place
Killing time and missing my cues
Watching her belong to you
Tears could only change my view
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x2)
Growing up has always been tough
Good intentions never good enough
I would take you far away
Do anything to make you stay
Take the L out of lover and it's over (x3)
Every drink and ciggarette
All those hands we never met
There are things we should forget
Now its over
Over

Take that big ol' booty girl and scrub the ground
You can do it up and down and round and round
As long as that pussy ain't stiff
Dance and make all the niggas look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin hell
I remember Magic City before the Freaknik
Before the police went on all them weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose with it
All them skinny hoes, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Let a nigga fuck tonight
Damn right bitch, fuck my wife

I bet she can't wiggle like with a dick in her
Have a motor booty contest and pick a winner
When she runnin', you never see a ho come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party

Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

The July sky, so high moon shining by the river side
Stealing hearts and running wild
In our own little world, Tennessee boys and girls running free
Out here it's good times for miles
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold
A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you want to do, what's it going to be
We can get a wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your back's sticking to the seat
We can sneak off to beat the heat
I'll be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee

How we do
Yo, all of my rhymes for all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Kill the late nights cruisin'
All you see is the brake lights, and hair blowin'
You know where we goin'
Or at the club in the rear frontin', poppin', droppin'
The amount some cats will wear, ain't trying to hear nothin'
Probably was wilder than Bobby, are you the Whitney to get me Hold me down and make me slow down the V-twizzy?
Keep the ice out the club lights change faces
Get I love wifey on the license plate
Wait, make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down
Cop you some sprinkles the hound with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep you jiggy all of my days, uh huh

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' 'bout you babe
Got me dreamin' 'bout you baby
All that I have
(All that I have)
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby

Anything that turn you on
I'll be givin' it to you babe
You don't have to worry baby

Yeah ha ha, check it
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life, loving me
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life (Uh huh)
Loving me
Now we going house shoppin'
Everybody wanna know the price your spouse droppin'
Keep that on the low R. Kelly style, it's quite shockin'
A year ago, all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockings
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle, rice droppin'
Got you a nice rock and...
Now it's on and poppin', droppin' hotter than platinum bracelets
Jigga, R. Kelly, Changing Faces, uhh

All I want is to be with you all of my days

And all we get in return is a peace of each other's time
Are we just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're playing for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation
Don't know if you're right, don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long
Don't make it hard (I won't), don't make it easy (hold you)
We'll just walk away (if you) at the end of the song (must go)
Baby, put one last nickel in the juke box
Give that love we once felt just one final spin around

To pretend no one can find

Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now
'Cause nobody loves me
It's true
Not like you do
Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday
Oh these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me

Of innocence, decent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide ....

Nobody loves.. me

Going out and stayin' far too long

It's what you put back in it
Take you chance, there's no doubt
Everything will all work out
See my way, I know where I'm goin'
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up

Even though she let me down
If my baby don't come home to me
In this one tear
In this one tear I'm gonna drown
Every night I, I say a prayer
And I whisper something, Lord
I've got to get my baby back
So this one tear
So this one tear will let me go
You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me
You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me"
rain in the summertime,the alarm,1988,1980,"Under the anvil of the sun
Sweat, like a train
I come, I come
My body to dust
Scorched by the might of the sun
Burning light, burning white heat
Like wildfire
I sweat a fever
My body screams
Disintegrates in the heat
Our love is the FAITH that keeps on burning
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
Burnt at the stake, on a bed of fire
My body rises
Taking me higher
My loves desire
Is pure ascension fire
And love is the FAITH that keeps on burning
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
I love to feel the RAIN IN THE SUMMERTIME
I love to feel the rain on my face
And then I run 'til the breath tears my throat
'Til the pain hits my side
As if I run fast enough
I can leave all the pain and the sadness behind

I love to feel the rain on my face

someone,el debarge,1987,1980,"Someone just like me

Somehow found my someone

Close to you

When the world's asleep
And we're sharing sweet
Solitude
Almost gave up
Trying to find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Still can't believe it
What were the odds of

Was that me?
Not long ago
No one here to care
No one's dreams to share
You agree
Nights can be rough
When you can't find someone else in love

Soft talk

'Cause the way I could display my style is wicked
So run up to your counters, and go and get your tickets

But I got flavor like that candy in your grocery shop
The dramatical, craft-matical, soul fanatic
An addict, with the crazy flow that's automatic
Flowin' like them bolts from the sky like Zeus
An old schooler, who drops mathematics like a ruler

Tracks, like thunder and lightning
My style frightening, can't you tell?
I'm loco, ooh, they don't know me very well, so
I lumps 'em, eeh, bruise 'em with black eyes and stitches

Freaks it, hic-up!

And on my screens than Vanna White
How should I roll when I write?
Then light the spliff, now it's time to recite
A verse, a hearse you be leavin' in

Fascinated, with this beautiful face
Watching her eyes
There focusin' on me
Pay attention, she is talking to me

Is what everyone does

Distracting, forget where you were
Strangers can fall in love

And you wind up cryin' the blues
And the lonelies person that you know
Is starin' out of the mirror at you you you
Are the stranger
And you know the danger
It'll be right

But it's easy come and easy go
Oh I'm sorry but it's true

Burnin' out and burnin' me

a.d.i.d.a.s.,killer mike ,2003,2000,"All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Marion Barry calls for crack or like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' Cuban coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra
Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow


When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom"

When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad

I asked you to go to the Weezer concert
You said you never heard of them (how dare you)
How cool is that? (not at all!)
So I spectated you and looked you're wearing:
Purple paint-painted gibus with a couple of stranges

Flamethrower with a strange part
Allies extinguished? Where do I start!

I have to beg you for it
I don't have a sandwich
And there's not a single health pack
How stupid is it?
Did the game teach you this?
Just come up to me and say goodbye to my health
How stupid is it?
For all I know you're trying to
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe your mouse does not have an M2


I wish I could get my health out of the red
Cause I think we'd make a good team
And we could rock out to Bloody Stream
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
Cause I'm low and I'm about to die
It's so dire, so meet me at spire
I'll kill all the Spies if you kill all the fire
We're on the same team, so please
Come and help me, I'm dying, whoa

Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken

This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right

Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow

Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it

You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel

Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time

I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, is there healing?
In your name I find meaning
So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be okay

The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you"

Big chips! Big trips to Vegas, nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this

sometimes (it's a bitch),stevie nicks,1991,1990,"Well, I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I try to dance with
What life has to hand me
My partner's been pleasure
My partner's been pain
There are days
When I swear I could
Fly like an eagle
And dark desperate hours
That nobody sees
My arms stretched triumphant
On top of the mountain
My head in my hands
Down on my knees
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
I've reached in darkness
And come out with treasure
I've laid down with love
And I woke up with lies
What's it all worth
Only the heart can measure
It's not what's in the mirror
But what's left inside
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
You gotta take it as it comes
Sometimes it don't come easy
I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
And I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I tried to dance with
What life had to hand me
And if I could
I'd do it all over again
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes the picture
Just ain't what it seems
You get what you want
But it's not what you need
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze

Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience what some women won't in they lifespan
I'm sayin
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real

surrender,trixter,1991,1990,"Words of silence echo through this lonely room
Just a photograph and dreams that won't come true
I'll never know why I left you standin' in the rain
Cryin' tears of emptyness it's drivin' me insane
All I wanted was to love you
Never wanted to see you cry
All I need is just to hold you
I just can't say - Goodbye
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
You use words as weapons I use love as a shield
So tell me why are we on this battlefield
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down your arms and baby let's surrender
And thought my aim is true
I sometimes miss the mark
Ooh, in matters of the heart
But I'd give my life tonight
To hold you in my arms
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way
I just wanna hold you (surrender)
I just wanna love you (surrender)
I never meant to make you cry
Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender

blue monday 1988,new order,1988,1980,"How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today


I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tеll me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to lеave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold

Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'

Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez

Because your naps ain't nappy enough (Shadowboxing)
And your reach ain't rugged enough, bitch

Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now

someone else calling you baby,luke bryan,2011,2010,"I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl

No, don’t try to save me

Gets rid of the pain of being a man

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right

Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself

And I don't even know your name
But my heart skips a beat and I feel weak
When my eyes tell my heart he comes again

I hope with all my heart that it's not true
'Cause boy I'd wanna share my love with you
I know that's it not right
Nor is it lady-like
For a girl to come right out
And tell a guy how she feels
But I want you to know that deep down in my soul
I'm experiencing something wonderful and new
And it's...

Never ever ever gonna let you go

biological didn't bother,shaquille o'neal,1995,1990,"Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(chorus)

Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother
(Chorus)"
did it for the girl,greg bates,2012,2010,"I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash
I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl
I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget
I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl
I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her
I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight
Anything to make her mine, all mine, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl"

At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side

Yea, point at you

Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this

It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home

I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin' home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...
The doorbell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Ain't nobody do it like Aaron can)
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said
People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around, come on
(Come get it)
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)

(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh what what
(Come get it)
(Come get it)

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Things are goin' great then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellas, yo, ya gotta get out
(Hey man I heard this was an open house)
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
Well I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)
Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and
Another kid broke the lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on

Aaron C's in the house, here we go
Come with it

Break it down
(go go go go go...)

Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double
I'm dead (you're done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test
The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left
(AARON!!!???!!!)
Grounded

People all around you gotta

The way you used to gently touch my face

And when the nights get lonely
I think of what you told me
Saying that I was the one

I know that we can love
Like we did then
So, bring it on home"

We were hanging on
We come together

strawberry wine,deana carter,1996,1990,"He was working through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now, years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much?

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine"

But you never want to listen to who I am
We're divided, completely out of touch

Believe me, darling, this ain't no game
If you think I'll be your fool, you better think again
I know you love me, but it just ain't right
I'm sick and tired of fighting with you every night

You say you don't wanna hurt me
But you're doing things I can't explain
Oh baby, why don't you leave me?
'Cause you know I'll never change

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
But one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
I'll find a honey to take a chance
And roll that dice into my past
She'll cover me for a little while
And show me love ain't out of style

I don't care how long it takes
My heart's in the hands of fate
Oh God I ain't asking much
Just a woman that I can trust

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
Oh but one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I wanna love that's strong and real
I gotta know just how it feels
Somebody to share my life
To hold onto through the night

Nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I may get used to

she's a river,simple minds,1995,1990,"Shadow let go
There's something you should know
I just found my new direction
And I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it
She's like the wind that sucked me through it
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me
Stand back - get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection
Got a resurrection feel
When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
And I go blind
Wasting my time
While the rivers in front of me
That's where I'm goin' to be
Shine on, get on
Twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the spirit of creation
She's the last chance guarantee
Got a myriad of poses
Sweet miracles and roses
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
'Cause when I find
My state of mind
The river's in front of me
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon
My nerves just feel electrified
Meet me on the staircase
Outside a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame
The voice of Mother Nature states
All things must pass
And nothing can remain
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
You raise me like a building to the very top
Rush me to the end of time
You fill me full of danger
You give me future shock
Then you leave me wasted dying
And I go blind
Wasting my time
The river's in front of me"
out of my bones,randy travis,1998,1990,"I'm in need of a remedy To cure me from loving you
It may sound a little extreme I'll do what I have to do
Chorus:
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
Keep walking till the hurting stops
Keep walking till my temperature drops
Keep walking till the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones
I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones
Sweet amnesia come and set me free
I just need to get you out of me"
all fall down,five star,1985,1980,"All fall down, all fall down
All fall down
I used to wake up at night
Feelin' so lonely
Before I knew you really loved me
I used to cry in my sleep
With tears on my pillow
I didn't think you wanted to know
But now you've change my world
I'm wondering how to keep myself from falling over
You're a special boy, my baby
And when you touch me
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home
I used to be so unsure
Afraid I'd discover
You want a friend but not a lover
But there's no fear in my mind
'Cause now we're together
Our love keeps growing bigger, be sure
I could jump for joy, you sweet thing
See me walk on air when people staring
They're looking at our mystery
And when, when you smile we
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known
(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I'll follow
'Cause you can lead me home
You're makin' me dance, make me sing
Anything, as long as you are here with me
I've found I can't touch the ground
You know you've made my inhibitions
(All fall down)
(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known

ain't no future in yo' fronting,m.c. breed ,1991,1990,"Intro : (Flavor Flav)
To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say ""How Breed?"" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)
There ain't no future in your frontin'

I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at 
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', ""Eric Breed is gettin' over""
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'
Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that
(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors
Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

I see electricity in the pylons
Look at it running the race, everything you doing erased
What it feel like? Hit with the mace
Tight pace that I'm keeping, got the reaper on me
Like you, what the hell would I be?
Without it, if you think it, shout it
Lost my mind, i think I found it, away
Live to fight, another bright day
I am God, so why would I pray?
You are God, above a white page
The creator, maker of rage
Painter paint the canvas, I ate the mantis
I saved the pandas, I hate they brand us
Can us like some Campbells
Jesus had no socks under his sandals
I can't ride a bike without the handles
I can't ride a scooter, have a tutor
Shoot the Buddha, eat some gouda
Say it ruder, tell who did I trample
Ramble on about some nonsense, I'm unconscious
I don't have cricket for a conscience
Kelp forest, where the magic conch is
Violent crucifying like I'm Pontius
Pilot flying high above Olympus
She's an angel, give that bitch a nimbus
Bengal tiger biting off your fingers
How am I supposed to eat these Pringles?
Image in your head is how I want it
Finish on the bed and lie upon it

I just didn't answer
Got her foot up on the dash
She my tiny dancer

Move it hula girl
Not a girl with cuter curls
I'ma stack these commas
We could be like the Obamas (Huh)
We could rule the world
Baby girl, just pick a country
Ain't worried bout no money
Ain't worried bout no-
-fast

Foot up on the gas
Everything we tend to pass
Leave it in the past
I know what my momma asked
I just didn't answer
Got her foot up on the dash
She my tiny dancer

Breakin-breaking down the gas
Don't want, smoke want cancer
You could-you could-you could ask
You can't get me canceled
Shake it-shake it-shake your ass
How it in your pants too?
How he do it?
You could ask
Grip this pen no pencil
Baby-baby-baby girl
Shake that ass for a nigga, I'll give you the world
Man, I love it how you bend your back and make it curl
Yeah, I put that necklace on yo' shit like pearls
Yeah, I cook that rock I stir it, make it twirl
Part 3

Yuh
I got a story for y'all (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, I do, I do, I do)
But I gotta kinda build it up a little bit (Lil bit, lil bit, lil bit)
I've been having a lot of bad dreams lately (I have, I have, I have)
And no matter what the fuck I do they won't go away
(They won't, they won't, they won't)
So I'ma talk about the place in my brain that I think they stay

Look
I had a dream about that nigga there in that photo (Okay, okay)
I had a dream that I shot you and yo' niggas in that photo
And it ain't right, bad dreams clouding up my sight
Can't get any rest in the night
Why the hell when I close my eyes am I not surprised? Someone always dies
Why the hell when when I close my pupils someone you lose comes to life
There ain't shit to fight, there ain't shit to point at with the pipe
Somethin' in my mental isn't right
Maybe it's all the hatin' ass niggas talkin' to me every day
About how the fuck they got a problem with what I be doin'
Maybe it's this hatin' ass bitch tellin' Lil Darkie not to say
The n-word even though she ain't knew him
And I'm always talking about spreadin' love and positivity
So maybe it's a little hard for me to put that shit behind me, and say screw 'em
Or lawyer up and go sue 'em, what am I doin'?
It's hard for me to let go of the hate
Especially when I want you to do great
Especially when them fuckers stall my fate
And you distractin' me because you ain't
Wit' it now my brain say slit it, take yo' blood and paint wit' it
Do it 'till you faint, do it 'till you can't anymore
I'll do this 'till I can't anymore
Is that my blood, or the paint on the floor?
Is that my blood, or the paint on the floor
I'm just a person who's mental state
Tend to worsen now I'm cursin' on a track
Oh you wear a beanie? That jack is my night cap
I'm spittin' heavy you ain't ready insider you might crack
I knew a mother of one son, one daughter, liked crack
She was my friend, she got kicked out of her apartment
For bringing the children harm, and it's scarring
My brain alarmin', I saw it
Her husband drink until he barely was thinking
They like my music though (Oh, we love your music!)
I see you got them bodies but you ain't actin' a human though
How you let your kids see you separate then abuse 'em though?
Momma smokin' cigs on the corner and daddy boozin' mo'
Now that bitch a racist 'cause her husband is
Fuckin' wit' darker faces, ain't puttin' dick where her waist is
And she can't afford no braces to give her daughter some teeth
But she talking to one my friends
About how she would suck his dick if he drove her to ATM
So she the pullin' the money out and she spendin' it all on coke
Now she broker and want it back so she switchin' over to crack
I rap about whippin' rock but I never do that for real
'Cause it's funny just when you talk and it's not when you skippin' meals
And it's not when your skin, it peels
And it's, not when you makin' deals
And it's not when you got the cops taking children away it feels
Too close to home
Part 4

Tell us another one, Darkie...
I'll try
(No ad-libs)
Fuck
Yuh
Yeah, yeah
Uh

Back in high school, uh, I had this girl
She meant the world to a nigga, that's a pearl, that's a gem
In the end, she ended up wit' my friend
Now let me tell you how this steaming pile of bullshit began
Back in sophomore year, I couldn't drop more tears (Uh)
Because my last girl kicked me to the curb, not in the city in the 'burbs
I'm sittin' pretty with the birds, finally over that shit
Uh, will anybody love me? Pulling clovers I rip, them out
In PE I'm sittin' out, but she just wanna talk
She invite me to her crib after class, okay, why not?
I'm door knockin', but she took me inside, led me to her room
Uh, then she pulled off all my clothes without askin' me she assumed I was for it
I should have known right there, mission abort it
Ain't no relationship she want, she want dick and she looking for it
She said, ""Did you bring the condoms"" as if I had caused a problem
I'm lying naked on her bed feeling raped and fucked in the head
So she apologized, ""I'm just into taller guys""
She said that she was in the wrong, and I shouldn't tell anyone
So I forgave her, first mistake
It's hard to say it when you love someone that person fake
Mistook attention for true love and so we start to date
I'm with the bitch for two years and it's perfect, wait
It's senior year and she telling me she want smoke
And do drugs like the lean and coke
And she thinkin' that datin' me it prevent her from bein' free
I'm like ""Baby, what do you mean? I been giving you everything
I been living my life for you, I thought we were part of a team?""
And so she leave, and my homie tell me I'll be fine, and that he really feel me
Dealing poorly start to smoke a lot, now I'm a fucking greenie
Caught a case, so she definitely stay away, no free me
At lunch I see her wit' him and I know that he can see me
Hoe meet me at the bike racks, fight back
You bony piece of shit, you was my homie, I ain't know that it was like that
But that nigga might be the reason that I write raps
Hope my Indian fingers might put a divot in yo' white ass
Uh, bullied in middle school and bullied after I did time
Commit crimes, I ain't worried 'bout fuckin', I want that money and I lick minds
Bumpin' ScHoolboy Q, having some sick times
Sellin' weed, and you know you my nigga if you get big dimes
I was born from the darkness, once an innocent kid, spray paintin' where the park is
Don't go swimmin' where the shark is
(Well, I hope you enjoyed that story of my youth
Now it's time for this journey through my mind to come to an end
I hope you're ready)
Part 5

(Please keep all hands, arms, feet, and legs inside your thoughts at all times)

Troubled kid with the troubled mind, troubled kid with the troubled past
In the trouble I grew up fast, in the rubble I sit my ass down
I’ll smoke you like I smoke that grass, I broke him like I broke that glass, I dropped out ain't got no class
Had to cut off a lot of friends, had to cut off a lot of people
Cause lots of people round me were evil, cause lots of niggas were weak and feeble
Ommmmmm...
Thank God that I got out alive
My momma never lost faith in my mind

When I was young
I used to play with Legos 'till the morning sun
I used to play with Legos now it's boring, son
No one would play with me, I’m the foreign one
He ain't had no butthole, so I tore him one
I didn't know what a country was now I'm touring one
All I wanna do is get on tracks, I was born to run
In the field I grip that stick, it's a hole in one
Why would you commit a crime with a stolen gun?
Rat-a-tat-tat, grip that gat, and push his hat back
Is yo momma proud of you now?
No she's not this much is true now

possession,sarah mclachlan,1994,1990,"Listen as the wind blows
From across the great divide
Voices trapped in yearning
Memories trapped in time
The night is my companion
And solitude my guide
Would I spend forever here
And not be satisfied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Through this world I stumble
So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved
Oh you speak to me in riddles
And you speak to me in rhymes
My body aches to breathe your breath
Your words keep me alive

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Into this night I wander
It's morning that I dread
Another day of knowing of
The path I fear to tread
Oh into the sea of waking dreams
I follow without pride
It's nothing stands between us here
And I won't be denied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear
I hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes"

But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow

right here,staind,2005,2000,"I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how could you collect them all and throw them in my face?

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending 'til I break

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
If you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting
I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away
Would you be right here waiting?

Can't escape from the things that line our way
Take it, leave it, break it
Anyway, you can't get back to yesterday
All I want, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
You better listen from now on
Confidence, coincidence, call it a sin
It's just like people say
Tomorrow's here so open up your eyes
And never hesitate
All I want, all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on
It makes me want to give you everything
Pick you up and take you home again
Hold you tight and think that now is then
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
You better listen from now on
Open arms or crying eyes
Say hello or wave goodbye
Which one are you thinking of?
All I want, all I wanna do
Is make you listen from now on
Stop what's going on
Stop what's going wrong
From now on
It's all I wanna do, all I wanna say
You better listen from now on
Sleeping in the dark, dreaming of the stars
Keep one to wish on from now on

Is everything I feel from now on"

Just let me go

'Cuz teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to hold you, touch you
Don't think that you're mine
Because it ain't no
World for an uptown girl whose teacher has told
Her goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at you feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
(chorus)
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry so I
Don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine because it ain't no

I'm so cold inside

Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land

Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording

closer to fine,indigo girls,1989,1980,"I'm trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
The best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it, I'm crawling on your shore

And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Closer I am to fine, yeah

I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper
And I was free
And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine, yeah
Closer I am to fine, yeah

I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
When I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain
Yeah, we go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival, and we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line

And I know I was wrong
I know we belong together
Look, this is kind of hard
For me to say to you
But I want you back, please
Just give me a second chance
I'm tired of living alone
The single life is not for me
Like a fool, I asked you for my freedom
I didn't think you'd leave so easily
Saw you just the other day
You were walking hand in hand
With someone new
It took me by surprise
And then, I realized
How much I needed you

A second chance for us
The second time could be better, baby
A second chance for love
This time around
We could make it, baby
Turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine
Ooh, we were so happy together
I never thought that I would
Swallow my pride
Now you're here
So please stay the night
I promise I will make it up to you
Don't ever go away
This love we've got to save
Cause no one else will do, no one

I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone
Oh, oh, yeah, ah, ah, yeah
I'm not meant to live alone
Why you being so difficult
You know you want me back
Come on, baby
Why you wanna treat me like that
I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone, oh, oh

Oh, yeah, come on, baby
Love me like this
I just want to feel your kiss
Love me like this"

You know I'm thankful
For what we have
But I have feelings inside
They're so strong
I can't hide

When you're here
I want you to stay
And when you're gone
I want you even more every day

Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up
I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

How many secrets can you keep?

That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

I'd tell him that it's over

You don't know any dance steps
That are new
But nobody else can love me
Like you do
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Darlin' I don't care
Oh, I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
I don't care

consequences,camila cabello,2019,2010,"Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

Yeah, loving you"

Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up

I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these

Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been

Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt

Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'

Keep that stack, hundred K in the stockin'
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress

That blunt ash on the floor

Going through my pockets, searchin' for clues
Trying to follow me, you and your desperate crew
The end of this relationship was long overdue

Easy on the tears, oops, man, you soil my suit
Do yourself a favor and find a new recruit
And don't take it personal because you got the boot

You're out on the streets (Looking good) (Absolutely)
And you know deep down in you heart that that ain't right (Come on, come on)
And, oh, you never, never hear me when I cry at night (Oh…oh…oh…oh…oh…)

I don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heart
And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amends
It's easier, can't you see? Let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other, but it's sure fun to pretend

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Everybody says you gotta know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave, you could always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz
I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz


Catch me a 'round here buzz

poetic justice,kendrick lamar ,2012,2010,"Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

Where is you from? Or it is a problem.""
""Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?""
""Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry.""

cowboy song,thin lizzy,1976,1970,"I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
A starry night, a campfire light
The coyote call, the howling winds wail
So I ride out to the old sundown

I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female
The nights we spent together riding on the range
Looking back it seems so strange

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Riding in the rodeo

I was took in Texas I did not know her name
Lord, all these southern girls seem the same
Down below the border in a town in Mexico
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Running free with the buffalo
Here I go
Roll me over and I'll turn around
And I'll move my fingers up and down
Up and down
It's okay, amigo
Just let me go
Riding in the rodeo

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Riding in the rodeo
Roll me over and set me free
The cowboy's life is the life for me"

Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else will baby

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone

Double talkers, backstreet walkers at every turn
Seedy motels and no star hotels still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my mind
Was the sweet love I had with you

And long before this baby boy
Could count to three
You knew just what he would become
Run along to school
No child of mine grows up a fool
Run along to school
When you tried to tell me what to do
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure

Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys

Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Dear mommy, dear daddy
Now I’m 19, as you see
I'm handsome, tall and strong
So what the hell gives you the right
To look at me as if to say “Hell, what went wrong?”
Where were you last night?
You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night?
Well I think that you may just be right
But don’t try to keep me in tonight
Because I’m big enough to break down the door

Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Boys like you are bad through and through
Still, girls like me
Always seem to be with you
We can’t help but worry
(You’re in such a hurry)
Mixing with the wrong boys
(Playing with the wrong toys)
Easy girls (And late nights)
Cigarettes (And love bites)
Why do you have to be so cruel?
You’re such a fool

Never, sad boys

What you do

I'll get rid of you

But what can I do? (I do, I do, I do)
You waste your time, like my money
It ain't so funny, but it's true

Now, you can't tell me
What's going on
And that I am weak
While you are strong
What is it you need

take your time,tre,1997,1990,"The word ""love"" is a hell of a word to be sayin'
You don't know how to use it with caution
It's a death-defying game to play
And when you're thinking of the one you wanna get next to
Be sure it's a mutual feeling
'cause these are the words they'll say
""Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on""
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong

Make sure the binds are closed""

Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out

The next day somebody else is misled
Who do you  love? (You have to ask yourself)
Is it someone you can count on?
Someone who's there for you
Someone who will be true
No matter what the situation may be
And are they sent from above?
This question is asked for a reason
'Cause some of them wanna play

How many strippings you wanna take
Until you learn the game's another definition for play?

she loves me not,papa roach,2002,2000,"When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that
She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over
I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk

Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fighting all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad
On the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
Tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout
I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time

Loves me not

someday,rob thomas,2010,2010,"You can go
You can start all over again
You can try to find a way to make another day go by
You can hide
Hold all your feelings inside
You can try to carry on when all you wanna do is cry

And maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
Try to put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to make things better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

Now we wait
And try to find another mistake
If you throw it all away, then maybe you can change your mind
You can run
And when everything is over and done
You can shine a little light on everything around you
Man, it’s good to be someone

I don’t wanna wait
I just wanna know
I just wanna hear you tell me so
Give it to me straight
Tell it to me slow

‘Cause maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
We’ll put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to just to feel better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

‘Cause sometimes we don’t really notice
Just how good it can get
So maybe we should start all over
Start all over, again"

When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
""Ring Of Fire"" or ""Amazing Grace""

Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority
And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back

Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
Our neighbor had a pool

We got green grass and a few trees

We ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good, baby, but it's alright
Real life

We got a dive bar with a real band
They play too loud and they're real bad
But we're real bored so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems, but we do too
So we tip her anyway
That's just the way that it is
That's just the way that we live

This is real life in the real world
We ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls
We get real low, we get real high

believe in me,dan fogelberg,1984,1980,"If I could ever say it right
And reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor
Then you might
Come to believe in me
The life I lead is not the kind
That gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find
That you can believe in me
Those other loves that
Came before
Mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure
And will not believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real
If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real
If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Makes you believe in me
Oh, you can believe in me"

Yeah, I need reaction to action
Just one look that would kill me
You got a way of drawing attention to you
You know you stand out in a crowd
But the way that you play
With any man's affections
Should never be allowed
See I consider myself
The one who will show you
I'd go as far as to say
Girl, I ain't leaving here without you
But you better understand
There's only one rule in this game we're going to play
And that's reaction to action
Maybe like a word that would thrill me
I need reaction to action
One look that would kill me
Give me reaction to action
It's getting late I'd better make a definite move

Sixty from the field, strange sex appeal

Gotta understand these fake fucks are not your mans

Hangin' from a snake's mouth comin' out a pyramid
Now I'm at the steakhouse gettin' dirty looks
Guess I shoulda wore a different shirt
Poppin' wheelies on the Harley down 53rd
Break the guitar on your head after my solo shit

Got the Box Chevy jumpin' like a pogo stick

Yeah, don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo
Like Jerry West and Teddy Ballgame
I don't wear Balmain, swing the ball and chain executioner style
Dirty mountain tiger to the face
Better strap up, I'm 'bout to see space
As I entered, I felt everything was centered
Oh shit, I think I'm back in the placenta
But then I woke up in a Nissan Sentra
In the parking lot of Queens Center, uh (Don't hurt me baby)

And where can love take us now?
We've been so far down

We can still touch the sky if we crawl
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

Why did I change the pace?
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face (Your face)
So where are you standing now?
Are you in the crowd of my faults? (My faults, oh)
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance

We can still have it all so we'll crawl (If we crawl)
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

Everybody sees this you
Well, I never wanna lose that view

So we'll crawl (If we crawl) 'til we can walk again
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
So we'll crawl (If we crawl, oh) 'til we can walk again ('Til we can walk again)
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly (Yeah, yeah) until there is no wind
So let's crawl, let's crawl, let's crawl

come as you are,peter wolf,1987,1980,"They hung a sign out, sign out after seven

Just you tonight, it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
There'll be a high time, high time at the lakeside
Barry and the boys are going in for free
We'll jump the moon, take it for a joyride
I stuck it up there for you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade

But life's so short and I know what you're into

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere
All alone, suddenly you see her
So alone, you know you're gonna need her
Can't explain something that you're feeling

There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight

Someone to care
Now she's here, nothing seems to matter
She's so near, everything is better
Can't explain, something that you're feeling

Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)
Things I can't understand

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

broken hearted me,anne murray,1979,1970,"Every now and then I cry
Every night, you keep staying on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me

Every day is just the same
Playing games, different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive
It just takes time

But I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart

That time won't heal a broken hearted
Time won't heal a broken hearted me"
one and only man,steve winwood,1990,1990,"Every time I see you
Girl, it makes me feel so sad
Knowing you've been seeing
Some other guy that treats you bad
You know that I'm burning
Deep inside for you
Just give me the chance now
And we can see it through
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Gonna take me with you
Far away from hearts of stone
We'll live in the country
And raise some children of our own
I will be your lover
I will be your friend
I'll give you all my loving
On that you can depend
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
Take you to the city
Girl, we're gonna buy some clothes
Dress you up so pretty
Then we'll take in all the shows
Find a place that's jumping
Where the music's tight
And we'll keep on dancing till the morning light
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Be my woman, I'll be your man
Know I'm gonna give you everything I can
Be my woman, I'll be your man
There'll be no more running, gonna make a stand"
read 'em and weep,barry manilow,1984,1980,"I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or a fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you gave up and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
Well, I could tell you ""goodbye"" or maybe ""see you around""
With just a touch of a sarcastic ""thanks""
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
I've been whispering softly trying to build a cry up into a scream
We let the past slip away and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed-out dream
And I've been dreaming forever, hoping something would eventually come
I saw your eyes in the dark, I felt your kiss on my lips
I traced your body in the air until the bodies were numb
Well, I could tell you ""goodbye"" or maybe ""see you around""
With just a touch of a sarcastic ""thanks""
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks

If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
Oh, it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
Oh, it's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
(Read 'em and weep) For all the hours we'll be spending alone
(Read 'em and weep) For the dreams we'll ignore
(Running silent and deep) And all those promises we promised to keep
They won't be kept anymore
(Read 'em and weep) For the magic that our bodies had made
(Read 'em and weep) For the blood that we've lost
(Running silent and deep) And all those secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost
(Read 'em and weep) For the memories still alive in the bed
(Read 'em and weep) For the lies we believed
(Running silent and deep) And all the things that will have never been said
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
Come on and look at me and read 'em
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep

Another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head
From what went down last night
I know we both have our own little ways
But somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say
I guess it don't even matter

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?

I've always listened to your point of view, my ways I tried to mend
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better

As sure as I'm a victim of desire

Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell

Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers

Love has a strange way of finding out
Everything in your heart
Strangest of all is you never know
Just what it is that's tearing you apart
Seasons may pass, summers come and go
Dreams flashing through your mind
Love is something that you dream about
Something that you left behind
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Time has a strange way of reaching out
The years turn to yesterday
Reach out a hand, try to grab the past
Stop it all slipping away
Happens to you almost anywhere
A flash before the storm
Just reach out a hand, try to touch her face
Only to find she is gone
Just like I told you again
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Never known love burn so bright
Little girl could have been so right
We could have been so happy
I won't be there
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Love has a strange way of turning round
When happiness turns to pain
Something that you thought you had has gone
And somehow things will never be the same
That hurt gets so bad as the days go by
A hurt that no drug can cure
There's only one thing that can satisfy
There's only one thing I'm longing for
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home"

holy,justin bieber ,2020,2020,"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"
the christmas song (merry christmas to you),nat king cole,2020,2020,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you"""

laugh now cry later,drake ,2020,2020,"Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?"
i hope,gabby barrett ,2020,2020,"I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Like you did on me"
champagne problems,taylor swift,2020,2020,"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"
