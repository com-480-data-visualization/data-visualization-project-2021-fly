I never got a chance to see him; Never heard nothin  but bad things about him. Mama I m depending on you to tell me the truth. Mama just looked at him and said,  Son, Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.  Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.  Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, That Papa never worked a day in his life? And Mama, they talk all around town say that Papa had three outside children and another wife And that ain t right. Heard them talkin  about Papa doing some storefront preachin  Talkin  about saving your souls and All the time weak, dealin  in death And stealin  in the name of the Lord Mama just hung her head and said, Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.  Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.  Hey, Mama, I Heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades. Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave? Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills. Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin ; Spend most of his time chasin  women and drinkin ! Mama, I m depending on you to tell me the truth. Mama just hung her head and said,  Son, Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.  Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.  Papa was a rollin  stone. Wherever he laid his head was his home. And when he died, all he left us was alone.
